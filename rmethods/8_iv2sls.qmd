## The problem: Endogeneity

- As I mentioned at the beginning, one of the most important assumptions required to analyze data and obtain correct estimations and draw inference was A4: **No endogeneity** or $E(e|X)=0$
  - Endogeneity is a problem that occurs because the error is related to $X$.
  - This is a proble,, because we can no longer assume the error is, in average, constant when analyzing changes in $X's$

## 

- Why did it happen?
  - Usually because important variables are omitted
    - Add them back, or at least proxies?
  - Incorrect functional form
    - Try making it more flexible?
  - Data has measurement error
    - Get better data?
  - Sample is endogenous (other treatments are necessary)
  - Reverse causality (you dont know which cause which)
  - Simultenaity, similar to omitted variables. There is another factor that caused both the outcome and explanatory variable

## A pair of Solutions

- Today we will cover one approach that could help with many (not all) the situations that could cause endogeneity.
- To apply this approach, however, we need:
  - More data (more variables with specific properties)
  - More information on how the "system" works.

- These methods are:
  - IV - Instrumental variable
  - 2sls - Two-stage Least squares

> NOTE: These two methods are almost interchangable. 
> 
> - IV refers to cases with 1 endogenous variable and 1 "instrument"
> 
> - 2sls refers to cases with 1+ endogenous variables and "instruments"

## What is an "***Instrumental Variable***"

- I have mentioned a few times the word "instrument" But what are they really?

- Instruments: the heros/variables that will "save us" of endogeneity.

- They have at least 2 properties:
  
  1. Instruments should be exogenous to the model 
   
    - This means that they do not appear in the theoretical specification, thus there is no **DIRECT** conection between the instrument $Z$ and the outcome $y$.

    - Also that there is no correlation between the model error and $Z$.

  2.  The instrument is relevant and related to $x$ (endogenous variable)
   
    - Preferably, you need a variable that is not only correlated with $X$ but determines changes in $X$.
    - We also need this effect to be monotonic! 

- In many instances we even want an instrument that is just as good as [conditionally] random. 

## How Instruments work: The math

The problem $corr(x_1,e) \neq 0$:
$$\begin{aligned}
y &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + e || \tilde w = w-\bar w  \\
\tilde \beta_1 &=\frac{\sum \tilde x_1 \tilde y}{\sum \tilde x_1^2}=
\frac{\sum \tilde x_1 (\beta_1 \tilde x_1 + e)}{\sum \tilde x_1^2} \\
& = \beta_1 + \frac{\sum \tilde x_1 e}{\sum \tilde x_1^2} 
\end{aligned}
$$

How IV works $corr(z_1,e) \neq 0$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\hat \beta_1 &=\frac{\sum \tilde z_1 \tilde y}{\sum \tilde z_1 \tilde x_1}=
\frac{\sum \tilde z_1 (\beta_1 \tilde x_1 + e)}{\sum \tilde z_1 \tilde x_1} \\
& = \beta_1 + \frac{\sum \tilde z_1 e}{\sum \tilde z_1 \tilde x_1} 
\end{aligned}
$$

## How Instruments work: The intuition

- One way of thinking about how IV works is by realizing not ALL changes in $X_1$ are endogenous. Some **are** due to $e$, but some are due other factors.
  - we just can't differentiate them
  - If we could use (in the regression), only exogenous changes, (or omit endogenous ones), we could estimate our models correctly.
  
- What IV's do is to identify **Part** of the exogenous component (the one related to $Z$), and use only THAT variation to identify coefficients.
  - This would do a reasonable work, as long as the instrument is relevant, and instrument exogenous. 

## Example

$$\begin{aligned}
e &\sim chi(2)-2 ; z = chi(2)-2 ; x = chi(2)-2+z+e \\
y &=1+x+e
\end{aligned}
$$

## SE and Statistical Inference

- SE have a different structure compared to OLS.
- In the simplest case (one dep variable that is endogenous), and under the assumption of Homoskedasticity,  SE for $\beta_1$ are given by:

$$\begin{aligned}Var_{iv}(\beta_1) = \frac{\hat\sigma^2_e}{SST_x R^2_{x|z}} \\
\hat\sigma^2_e =\frac{ \sum (y-\hat\beta_0-\hat\beta_1 x)^2}{n-2}
\end{aligned}
$$

- Once they are obtained t-stats can be used as usual

## Examples of IV's

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Education:

- Fathers Education
- Distance to School
- \# Siblins
 
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Veteran Status:

- Vietnam Lottery Ticket

Other:

- Rain 
- Shift-Share
- Judge FE
:::

::::


- IV SE will be necessarily larger than OLS, because there is less variation of $x$ used to identify $\beta$.
- If $x$ is used as its own instrument, the estimator will be that of OLS.

## Weak and endogenous instruments:

- While instruments can be used to address Endogeneity problems, finding good instruments can be hard.
  - They can be "weak-instruments"
  - or not fully exogenous

- If this happens, IV can be worse than endogeneity:

$$\begin{aligned}
plim \beta_{ols} &= \beta_1 + corr(x,u) \frac{\sigma_u}{\sigma_x} \\
plim \beta_{iv}  &= \beta_1 + \frac{corr(z,u)}{corr(z,x)} \frac{\sigma_u}{\sigma_x} 
\end{aligned}
$$

- we will talk about the "weak-instruments" later today.
 
## 

add code to simulate weak instruments
```{stata}

```

## IV with MLR
Adding controls...is easy!

$$y = \beta_0 + \gamma_1 y_1 + X\beta + e ; z \text{ instrument for } y
$$

We still assume 1 endogenous variable ($y_1$) and one instrument ($z$)

$$X =\begin{bmatrix} 1 & y_1 & x_1 & x_2 & x_3 \end{bmatrix} ; 
Z =\begin{bmatrix} 1 & z & x_1 & x_2 & x_3 \end{bmatrix}
$$

then $\hat\beta_{iv}$ is given by

$$\hat\beta_{iv} = (Z'X)^{-1}{Z'y}
$$

- Same assumptions needed, except that instrument strength is measured by the $corr(y_1-E[y_1|X], z-E[z|X] )$
  - Multicollinearity problem can be a problem here
  
## IV and Treatment Effects

One small note:

- When analyzing the model of interest, we could also try to analyze the reduced form model:

$$y = \beta_0 + \lambda z + X \beta + e$$

- This model will not give you the effect of $y_1$ (endogenous variable), but can be just as interesting, specially when instrument and endogenous variables are dummies.

  - In such case $\lambda$ will represent the "intention-to-treat" effect, rather than "treatment" effect.

# 2SLS: Many Ys many Zs

## 2SLS: Many Ys many Zs

- There could be situations where you have not one, but many instruments.
  - This may be rare, as even finding a single instrument can be hard
- You may also have the situation where there is more than one endogenous variable!
  - In such case, you need at least as many IVs as endogenous variables

1. The same assumptions as before apply. IV's need to be exogenous, but relevant to explain the endogenous variables.

2. Contrary to intuition, ALL instruments are used to analyze ALL exogenous variables

## 2SLS: Estimation

Consider the following:

- $y$ is the variable of interest
- $x1, x2$ set of exogenous variables 
- $y1, y2$ set of endogenous variables
- $z1,z2,z3$ set of instruments for $y1$ and $y2$

$X's$ and $Z's$ are exogenous:

##

Model of interesed:
$$y = a_0 + a_1 y_1 + a_2 y_2 + b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2 +  b_3 x_3 + e
$$

First Stage 

$$\begin{aligned}
y_1 = \gamma^1_0 + \gamma^1_1 z_1+ \gamma^1_2 z_2+ \gamma^1_3 z_3+\lambda^1_1 x_1 + \lambda^1_2 x_2 +  \lambda^1_3 x_3  + v_1 \rightarrow \hat y_1 \\
y_2 = \gamma^2_0 + \gamma^2_1 z_1+ \gamma^2_2 z_2+ \gamma^2_3 z_3+\lambda^2_1 x_1 + \lambda^2_2 x_2 +  \lambda^2_3 x_3  + v_2 \rightarrow \hat y_1
\end{aligned}
$$

Second Stage:

$$y = a_0 + a_1 \hat y_1 + a_2 \hat y_2 + b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2 +  b_3 x_3 + e
$$

This last model should work, because $\hat y_1$ and $\hat y_2$ are exogenous (if $Zs$ are).

Standard Errors, however, need to be adjusted appropietly.

##

$$\begin{aligned}
X = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & y_k & x  \end{bmatrix} \\
Z  =\begin{bmatrix} 1 & z   & x \end{bmatrix} 
\end{aligned}
$$

Then 
$$
\beta_{2sls} = [X'Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'X]^{-1}[X'Z(Z'Z)^{-1}Z'y]
\beta_{2sls} = [\gamma'Z'X]^{-1}[\gamma'Z'y]
\beta_{2sls} = [\hat X'X]^{-1}[\hat X'y]
$$
