Question 1

consider the following matrixes

$A=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\
3 & 3 & 8
\end{pmatrix}$

$B=\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 & 6 \\
2 & 1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}$

$C=\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 1 & 6 \\
1 & 1 & 2 \\
4 & 2 & 6
\end{pmatrix}$

Consider the following Operations:

$A + B$

$A + B'$

$A * B$

$Det(C)$

$C^{-1}$

$A' * B$

$(A * B')^{-1}$

Indicate if they are valid operations. if not, explain why
If they are obtain the resulting matrices.

Question 2

Consider the following functions:

$y=1+x^2-3x^3$

$y=ln(3x^2+1)$

$y=exp(x+x*z)$

For each one estimate: $\frac{\partial y}{∂ x}$ and  $\frac{\partial^2 y}{∂ x^2}$

Question 3
Solve the following set of equations. If not, indicate why they cant be solved:

Eq1

$\begin{aligned}
2x+y  &=  3 \\
2x+2y &= -3
\end{aligned}$

Eq 2

$\begin{aligned}
2x+ y + z &= 1 \\
3x+ 2y - z &= 2 \\
 x+ y - 2 z &= 3 \\
\end{aligned}$

Eq 3

$x^2 + x - 2 =0$

Question 4: Maximization

1)
Consider the following set of functions:

$\begin{aligned}
y &= A  x^α z ^\beta \\
C &= p_x x + P_z z
\end{aligned}$

Set up the constrained maximization problem.


2) consider the following function:

$y = f(z)$

If you were to maximize this function, what are the first order conditions?

If there is a unique solution, what are the conditions to verify it is the maximum.

Question 5

P1)

Consider the following set of numbers

$x = \{10, 4, 5, 7, 3, 6, 9\}$

Estimate the mean, median, and variance of this data.

p2)

Say that X is a continuous random variable that ranges from -10 to 10.

 - What is the probability that X=1 ($P(x=1)$)
 - True or False $P(X>1) + p(X<1)=1$
 - True or False $P(X>1) + p(-1<X<2)$ can be larger than 1.

P3)

Say that Z1 and Z2 are two random variables that follow a bernulli distribution. Assume that the following probabilities are true:

- p(z1=0 \& z2=0) = 0.1
- p(z1=1 \& z2=1) = 0.2
- p(z1=0) = 0.5
- p(z2=1) = 0.6

What is the probability for:

- Probability Z1=1 conditional on z2=0
- unconditional probability of Z1=1

p4. Given two random variables x_1 and x_2, with means and variances $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$ and $\sigma^2_1$ and $\sigma^2_2$.

if z = x_1 - x_2, what is the mean and variance of Z

what is the covariance between z and x_1.
