## What is econometrics?

Econometrics is an amalgamation of Statistics and Economics, that typically analysis *nonexperimental* data.

-   **Statistics**: Because we make use of numerous properties and mathematical properties to obtain derive Statitics related to our data

-   **Economics**: Because we aknowledge that we use data that comes from **Agents** interactions, and as such as subject to erros.

We use both tools to analyze data from the world around us.

-   Your *Economic* intuition to make sense and explain relationships that you find, and *mathematics/statistics* to obtain estimates that are statistically sound.

## When is it useful?

Econometrics is useful whenever we aim to:

-   Test theories, Explore theoretical relationships, Verify Predictions

But also

-   We use Econometrics when we want to evaluate policies, or provide evidence for policy makers. Find that **Causal** effect.
    -   Caveat: We may not have the best data for this, but we can come up with cleaver designs to still do our job!

## Where does Econometric Fits in Empirical Research

### Obvious answer

-   You will need **Econometrics methods** to analyze your data, however, (just as a reminder) you should be aware of "HOW" an Empirical Research should be made:

**S1.** Research Question:

-   A question that is Answerable (within bounderies of Time/Money/and availabilty)
-   That should help us understand a Topic Better
-   That is Specific Enough to be feasible, but General Enough to be of interest.
    -   Keep it simple

## Where does Econometric Fits in Empirical Research

**S2.** Construct an Economic model

-   To understand what the problem before you start analyzing the research question. May not need a formal modeling (Heavy Math), but enough to have some understanding of the problem.

**S3.** Decide on the Econometric model

-   You need to decide what data is needed and is available your **model**.
-   How you will estimate the model (assumptions on methods)

**S4.** Estimate model, and Analyze Data

-   Estimate the model, using Economtric tools and Methods fitted to the **data** and the research question.
-   Explain results in light of your Economic Model, and theoretical predictions. The Economist in you!

## So you need **Data**

## Need for Data

Different types of data may allow for using different econometric methodologies, and answer different types of questions.

-   Keep in mind you will only have access to **SAMPLES**, never the **Population**

-   There will be instances that you come **close** to Population data, ie Census.

-   But Even Census data is not the Population (or Super Population we use in Econometrics).

## Types of Data:

**Cross-Section**: Sample of the population collects data on **Many** individuals in a single point in time.

**Time Series Data**: Data collected on a **single** individual across time.

**Panel Data**: Data collected for **Many** individuals who are followed across time.

**Repeated Cross-Section**: Pooled ***Cross-Section Data*** for different individuals collected at different points in time. Individuals are not followed across time.

## Before the Break:

### Causality, Ceteris Paribus, and Counterfactuals

Thee important concepts for the Class

-   **Causality**: This is what most applied research aims to identify. A **causal effect** is a change the variable interest experiences, only because a second variable **changed**, while all other factors remained FIXED.

    -   This is different from associations or correlations.

-   **Ceteris Paribus**: In Econometric analysis, *ceteris paribus* implies that all factors, except the one analyzed, are assumed constant (There is no change), thus leading to causality

-   **Counterfactual**: It is the consideration of what would have been if only a single factor changed in the analysis (for a given observation).

    -   What if didn't apply to the MSC at Levy? If you got miss your plane to the US? etc.

## Thinking about Counterfactuals is Key

For empirical work that aims to identify Causal Effects, it is important to understand the concept of counterfactual.

-   It will help you understand what is what you need to analyze,
-   How could those effects be identified in ideal scenarios (Experiments)
-   What the limitation of those scenarios are
-   And what alternatives are there to void those limitations

## Example: Causal effect of Fertilizer on Crops

RQ: By how much will the **production** of soybeans increase if one increases the amount of **fertilizer** applied to the ground?

CF: Same Piece of Land with and without Fertilizer (Impossible)

EXP: Randomly Use Fertilizers Across different Plots of Land (Expensive but feasible)

EA: Use *Regressions* to ***keep*** other all factors that can affect Land productivity fixed when Analyzing Expost Data (Inexpensive)

## Example: Causal Effect of Smoking on Babie's health

RQ: Does Smoking during Pregnancy decreases birthweight?

CF: We consider the same woman. In one case she smokes through pregnancy, in the other she doesnt. Compare Babies Weight.

EXP: Select a random sample of Pregnant Women and randomly select those who will be "forced" to smoke during pregnancy.

EXP1: Select a Randome sample of PW with history of smoking. Randomly offer them a voucher and Counceling to quit smoking.

EA: Consider women with similar characteristics, except for smoking, and compare their babies outcomes.

Read Chapter 2 of -The Effect- by Nick Hungtington-Klein. [here](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-ResearchQuestions.html)

In groups of X:

- Come up with a Research question, 
- Identify your main dependent variable, and the variable you want to analyze the *causal effect*.
- Describe relevant factors that may need to be considered for the analysis (Economic model).
- Describe how those factors may relate to the outcome, and your variable of interest.
- Describe an ideal *Experiment* you may run to identify the effect. Is it a feasible experiment?
- Is there any data you could use to answer this question?
