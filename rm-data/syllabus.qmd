## Term Paper (60% of final grade)

Throughout the semester, students will work on a multi-part research project that applies the techniques learned in class to real-world data. This project will require students to propose a research question, collect and clean data, conduct exploratory and regression analyses, and present their findings.

## Resources

- **Textbook**: Békés, G., & Kézdi, G. (2021). Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy. Cambridge University Press.
  There are additional resources available on the book's website: [Data Analysis](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/getting-started)
- **Software**: There are several statistical packages for analyzing data. In this course, we will be using the
software `Stata` to cover all materials in class. Slides are self-replicable, thus you can copy
and paste almost all code provided to replicate the results seen in class. The Institute will be
providing you with licenses for Stata/BE for the length of the course.

Stata offers many free short webinars and video tutorials that may be useful if you never used
Stata before, or even if you have some experience with it. Please see the [resources](https://riosavila.github.io/resources.html) page for more information.

If you decide to, you can also use R, Julia, or Python to study and work on the course materials
and homework. The book for the class has a repository with all the code in Stata, R and Python. It could be of 
great advantage to you to learn other languages, as they are widely used in the industry and academia.

As with many other skills, the best way to learn is to simply work with the software, work on
the book exercises, and ask any questions to me or your classmates when you find a problem
you could not find a solution for.

For the additional software, please look into Quarto, GitHub, Zotero and VSCode.

# Course Policies

- **Attendance**: Attendance is highly recommended. Classess will not be recorded, and except for exceptional cases, there will be no online classes. 
- **Late Assignments**: Late assignments will not be accepted unless prior arrangements have been made with the instructor.
- **Academic Integrity**: All work submitted must be your own. Plagiarism will not be tolerated and will result in a failing grade for the assignment or course.
- **AI usage**: The use of AI in the class is allowed. However, you must disclose any AI tools used in your assignments. AI is a tool you can use to generate ideas, edit your text, provide help with coding, etc. However, it is completely unacceptable to use AI to generate the entire assignment. You will have to be able to explain and defend your work in class.
