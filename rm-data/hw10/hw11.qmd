# Task: Predicting and Classifying the Chances of Reaching the Top 10% Chefs

In this task, you will analyze a simulated dataset of chefs participating in the fictional cooking show "MasterChef." Your goal is to build a model that predicts the probability of being in the top 10% of chefs, based on their characteristics.

## Dataset Description

The dataset `master_chef_simulated_data_with_names.csv` contains information about 3000 chefs, with the following variables:

- **Name**: The chef's full name.
- **Age**: Chef's age in years.
- **Experience**: Years of professional cooking experience.
- **KnifeSkills**: A score (1-10) assessing knife-handling skills.
- **PlatingAesthetics**: A score (1-10) for visual presentation.
- **Creativity**: A score (1-10) for innovative cooking.
- **ChallengeWinRate**: Percentage of cooking challenges won.
- **JudgesFeedback**: Average feedback score from judges (1-10).
- **StressManagement**: A score (1-10) for managing stress under pressure.
- **SocialMediaFollowing**: A normalized score for social media popularity (0-10).
- **Education**: Highest level of education attained (categorical).
- **Country**: The chef's country of origin.
- **CuisineSpecialty**: Primary cuisine specialty (categorical).
- **AudiencePopularity**: Audience rating (0-10).
- **SignatureDishes**: Number of signature dishes created.
- **UniqueIngredients**: Number of unique ingredients used in dishes.
- **HoursPracticed**: Average weekly hours of practice.
- **Top20Percent**: Indicator variable (1 if the chef is in the top 20%, 0 otherwise).

## Objectives

1. **Descriptive Analysis**:
   - Summarize the dataset to understand the distributions of key variables.
   - Explore how variables differ between chefs in the top 20% and those who are not.

2. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Use logistic regression to predict the probability of being in the top 20% (`Top20Percent`) based on the available characteristics.
   - Identify the most influential predictors of success.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess the model's goodness-of-fit and predictive power.
   - Use appropriate metrics (e.g., pseudo R-squared, ROC curve, and classification accuracy).

## Deliverables

Write a short report summarizing your findings, including the following:

- The logistic regression model and its interpretation.
- Evaluation metrics and conclusion on the modelâ€™s predictive power.
- Submit your Stata do-file or log-file documenting your workflow.
