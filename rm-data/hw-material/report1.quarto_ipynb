        "This report examines the crucial role of resource management in the popular real-time strategy game StarCraft. We will explore how effective resource allocation influences gameplay dynamics and strategic decision-making. The analysis will include a mathematical model of resource gathering, a visualization of unit production rates, and a comparison of resource types across different races.\n",
