# Introduction

This report examines the economic systems and dynamics present in Eric Ugland's popular LitRPG series, "The Good Guys." We will explore how the author integrates economic principles into the game-like world, analyzing their impact on character development and plot progression. The report will include a mathematical model of the in-game economy, a visual representation of economic trends, and a comparative analysis of different economic zones within the series.

# Main Body

## The Mathematical Foundation of the In-Game Economy

In "The Good Guys," the in-game economy is governed by a complex system of resource generation, currency valuation, and market dynamics. We can model the basic economic growth within the game using a modified version of the Solow-Swan model, as shown in @eq-economy:

$$
Y(t) = K(t)^\alpha (A(t)L(t))^{1-\alpha} e^{\beta Q(t)}
$${#eq-economy}

Where:

- Y(t) is the total production in the game world at time t
- K(t) is the capital stock
- A(t) is the level of technology
- L(t) is the labor force (players and NPCs)
- Q(t) represents the impact of quests and missions
- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants representing the elasticity of output with respect to capital and quests, respectively

This equation demonstrates how the unique elements of the game world, such as quests (Q), interact with traditional economic factors to drive growth and development.

## Economic Trends Across Game Zones

To visualize the economic disparities between different zones in the game world, we've compiled data on average player wealth across five major regions. @fig-wealth illustrates these differences:

```{python}
#| label: fig-wealth
#| fig-cap: "Average Player Wealth Across Game Zones"
#| echo: false
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

zones = ['Starting Town', 'Forest of Trials', 'Merchant City', 'Dragons Lair', 'Endgame Zone']
wealth = [100, 500, 2000, 5000, 10000]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(zones, wealth, color='goldenrod')
plt.xlabel('Game Zones')
plt.ylabel('Average Wealth (Gold Coins)')
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

As evident from @fig-wealth, there is a significant increase in average player wealth as they progress through the game zones. This economic progression serves as a motivator for players to advance in the game, mirroring real-world economic incentives[^1].

## Comparative Analysis of Economic Systems

The diverse economic systems present in "The Good Guys" series offer a rich ground for analysis. @tbl-ecosystems provides a comparison of these systems:

| Economic System | Primary Currency | Main Economic Activities | Player Impact |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Starting Town   | Copper Coins      | Basic trade, simple quests | Low           |
| Merchant City   | Gold Coins        | Complex trade, investments | High          |
| Dragon's Lair   | Dragon Scales     | Rare item trade, high-risk ventures | Very High     |

: Comparison of Economic Systems in "The Good Guys" {#tbl-ecosystems}

As shown in @tbl-ecosystems, the economic systems become more complex and impactful as players progress, offering increasing opportunities for wealth accumulation and economic strategy.

# Conclusion

The economic systems in Eric Ugland's "The Good Guys" series play a crucial role in shaping the game world and driving character progression. From the mathematical model of the in-game economy (@eq-economy) to the visual representation of wealth distribution (@fig-wealth) and the comparative analysis of economic systems (@tbl-ecosystems), we can see how economics is deeply integrated into the series' narrative and gameplay mechanics.

This analysis demonstrates that Ugland has created a rich, multi-faceted economic environment that not only enhances the realism of the game world but also serves as a key driver of player engagement and story development. As @johnson2022b notes, such complex economic systems in LitRPG novels contribute significantly to the genre's appeal and the immersive experience it offers readers.
