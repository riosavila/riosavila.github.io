        "\n",
        "LitRPG is a literary genre that incorporates elements of role-playing games into the narrative structure. According to @litrpg_guide2021, the genre typically features characters progressing through a game-like world, complete with statistics, levels, and skill trees. This unique blend of storytelling and gaming mechanics has led to a surge in popularity among readers who enjoy both literature and video games.\n",

        "## Character Progression in LitRPG\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the key features of LitRPG is the quantifiable progression of characters. This is often represented by a character's stats or attributes, which can be expressed mathematically. A common formula for calculating a character's overall power level in many LitRPG novels is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "Power Level = \\sqrt{(Strength + Agility) \\times Intelligence} \\times Level\n",
        "$${#eq-power}\n",

        "This equation (@eq-power) demonstrates how various attributes contribute to a character's overall capabilities, providing readers with a tangible sense of growth and achievement.\n",

        "## Reader Engagement in LitRPG\n",
        "\n",
        "The unique structure of LitRPG novels has led to high levels of reader engagement. To illustrate this, we conducted a survey of 1000 LitRPG readers, asking them to rate their engagement levels compared to traditional fantasy novels.\n"
