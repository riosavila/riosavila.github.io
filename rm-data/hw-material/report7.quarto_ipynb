As demonstrated by our analysis, including the network of alliances (@fig-alliances) and the key power factors (@tbl-power-factors), the balance of power is in constant flux. The reemergence of House Targaryen and their dragons has fundamentally altered the political landscape, challenging the traditional power structures in ways that will likely reshape the future of the Seven Kingdoms.\n",
