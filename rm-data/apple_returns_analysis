## Introduction

This case study examines how changes in Apple's stock price are related to changes in market prices (S&P500) during 2010-2020. We analyze monthly returns to understand:

1. The relationship between Apple stock returns and market returns
2. The relative risk of Apple stock compared to the market
3. Whether Apple stock tends to amplify market movements

## Data and Methodology

We use monthly stock price data for Apple and the S&P500 index from 2010 to 2020. Returns are calculated as percentage changes in prices between consecutive months:

$Return_t = \frac{Price_t - Price_{t-1}}{Price_{t-1}} \times 100$

### Time Series Visualization

The time series plot shows the monthly returns for both Apple stock and the S&P500 index. Key observations:

- Both series show considerable volatility
- Apple returns tend to have larger swings than the market
- The series appear to move together, suggesting positive correlation

### Descriptive Statistics

The summary statistics reveal:

- Mean returns are positive for both series
- Apple shows higher volatility (standard deviation)
- The range of returns is wider for Apple stock

### Returns Relationship Analysis

The scatter plot with regression line shows:

- A positive relationship between Apple and market returns
- Apple's returns tend to amplify market movements (slope > 1)
- Considerable dispersion around the regression line

## Regression Analysis

We estimate the following model:

$R_{Apple,t} = \alpha + \beta R_{S\&P500,t} + \epsilon_t$

Where:
- $R_{Apple,t}$ is Apple's stock return in month t
- $R_{S\&P500,t}$ is the S&P500 return in month t
- $\beta$ measures the sensitivity of Apple returns to market returns
- $\alpha$ represents the average excess return

## Conclusions

The analysis reveals:

1. Apple stock tends to amplify market movements ($\beta > 1$)
2. Higher volatility in Apple returns compared to market returns
3. Positive but imprecisely estimated excess returns ($\alpha$)
4. The relationship explains a moderate portion of Apple's return variation

These findings suggest Apple stock was riskier than the market during this period, with returns that tend to move in the same direction as the market but with larger magnitude.
