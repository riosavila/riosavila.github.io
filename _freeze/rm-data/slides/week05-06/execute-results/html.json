Here, it is important what you use as $y$ or $x$.\n- **Simple regression** uncovers mean-dependence between two variables.\n  - It amounts to comparing average values of one variable, called the dependent variable ($y$), for observations that are different in the other variable, the explanatory variable ($x$).\n- **Multiple** regression analysis involves **more** variables -> for later.\n\n## Regression - uses\n\n- Discovering patterns of association between variables is often a good starting point even if our question is more ambitious.\n- **Causal analysis**: uncovering the effect of one variable on another variable. Concerned with **one** parameter.\n- **Predictive analysis**: what to expect of a $y$ variable (long-run polls, hotel prices) for various values of another $x$ variable (immediate polls, distance to the city center). \n\n## Regression - names and notation\n\n- Regression analysis is a method that uncovers the average value of a variable $y$ for different values of another variable $x$.\n  \n$$\\mathbb{E}[y|x]=y^E = f(x)$$\n\n- dependent variable or left-hand-side variable, or simply the $y$ variable,\n- explanatory variable, right-hand-side variable, or simply the $x$ variable\n- \"regress y on x,\" or \"run a regression of y on x\" = do simple regression analysis with $y$ as the dependent variable and $x$ as the explanatory variable.\n\n## Regression - type of patterns\n\nRegression may find:\n\n- Linear patterns: positive (negative) association - average $y$ tends to be higher (lower) at higher values of $x$.\n- Non-linear patterns: association may be even non-monotonic - $y$ tends to be higher for higher values of $x$ in a certain range of the $x$ variable and lower for higher values of $x$ in another range of the $x$ variable\n- No association or relationship (A flat line)\n\n## Non-parametric and parametric regression\n\n- **Non-parametric** regressions describe the $\\mathbb{E}[y] = f(x)$ pattern without imposing a specific functional form on $f$.\n- Data driven and flexible, no theory\n- Can capture any pattern\n- **Parametric** regressions impose a functional form on $f$. Parametric examples include:\n  - linear functions: $f(x) = a + bx$;\n  - exponential functions: $f(x) = a x^b$;\n  - quadratic functions: $f(x) = a + bx + cx^2$,\n  - or any functions which have parameters of a, b, c, etc.\n- Restrictive, but they produce readily interpretable numbers.\n\n## Non-parametric regression: average by each value\n\n- Non-parametric regressions come (also) in various forms.\n- Most intuitive non-parametric regression for $\\mathbb{E}[y|x] = f(x)$ shows average $y$ for each and every value of $x$.\n- Works well when $x$ has few values and there are many observations in the data,\n- There is no functional form imposed on $f$ here.\n\n## Non-parametric regression: Categorical variable\n\n- Sometimes, there are no straightforward functional form on $f$ (linear not meaningful).\n  - Categorical variables\n  - Ordered variables.\n- For example, Hotels: average price of hotels with the same numbers of stars and compare these averages = non-parametric regression analysis.\n\n## Non-parametric regression: bins\n\n- With many $x$ values therea are two ways to do non-parametric regression analysis: bins and smoothing.\n- Bins - based on grouped values of $x$ (Discretization of $x$)\n  - Bins are disjoint categories (no overlap) that span the entire range of $x$ (no gaps).\n- Many ways to create bins - equal size, equal number of observations per bin, or bins defined by analyst.\n  - see `binscatter` or make your own\n\n## Non-parametric regression: `lpoly`\n\n- Produce \"smooth\" graph - both continuous and has no kink at any point.\n- also called smoothed conditional means plots = non-parametric regression shows conditional means, smoothed to get a better image.\n- Lowess = most widely used non-parametric regression methods that produce a smooth graph.\n- locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (sometimes abbreviated as \"loess\").\n- A smooth curve fit around a bin scatter.\n- wider bandwidth results in a smoother graph but may miss important details of the pattern.\n- narrower bandwidth produces a more rugged-looking graph\n- In `Stata` one of the commands for this its `lpoly` but also `lowess`.\n  \n## Non-parametric regression: lowess (loess)\n\n- Smooth non-parametric regression methods, including lowess, do not produce numbers that would summarize the $\\mathbb{E}[y]|x = f(x)$ pattern.\n- Provide a value $\\mathbb{E}[y]$ for each of the particular $x$ values that occur in the data, as well as for all $x$ values in-between.\n- Graph – we interpret these graphs in qualitative, not quantitative ways.\n- They can show interesting shapes in the pattern, such as non-monotonic parts, steeper and flatter parts, etc.\n- Great way to find relationship patterns\n\n## Case Study: Finding a good deal among hotels\n\n::: {#f35d0e42 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.stata .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\nset scheme white2\ncolor_style tableau\nuse data_slides/hotels-vienna.dta, clear\nqui:drop if distance>6\ntwo (lpolyci price distance, bw(.3) fcolor(%20)) ///\n(lpolyci price distance, bw(.6) fcolor(%20)) ///\n(lpolyci price distance, bw(.15) fcolor(%20)), ///\nlegend(order(2 \"bw(.3)\" 4 \"bw(.6)\" 6 \"bw(.15)\")) ///\nytitle(\"Price\") xtitle(\"Distance from CityCenter\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<style>div.jp-Notebook .datagrid-container {min-height: 448px; }</style>\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](week05-06_files/figure-revealjs/cell-2-output-2.png){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Linear regression\n\n## Linear regression\n\nLinear regression is the most widely used method in data analysis.\n\n- Imposes linearity assumption of the function $f$ in $\\mathbb{E}[y|x] = f(x)$. (Linearity of Coefficients)\n- Linear functions have two parameters, also called coefficients: the intercept and the slope.\n  $\\mathbb{E}[y|x] = \\alpha + \\beta x$ \n- Can be any function, including any nonlinear function, of the original variables themselves\n- This line is the best-fitting line one can draw through the scatterplot.\n- It is the best fit in the sense that it is the line that is closest to all points of the scatterplot.\n\n## Linear regression - assumption vs approximation\n\n- Assumption: The regression function is linear in its coefficients.\n- Approximation: Whatever the form of the $\\mathbb{E}[y|x] = f(x)$ the $\\mathbb{E}[y|x] = \\alpha + \\beta x$ regression fits a line through it.\n  - This may or may not be a good approximation.\n  \n## Linear regression coefficients\n\n$$\\mathbb{E}[y|x] = \\alpha + \\beta x$$\n\nTwo coefficients:\n\n- intercept: $\\alpha =$ average value of $y$ when $x$ is zero:\n  - $\\mathbb{E}[y|x=0] = \\alpha + \\beta \\times 0 = \\alpha$.\n- slope: $\\beta =$ expected difference in $y$ corresponding to a one unit difference in x.\n  - $\\mathbb{E}[y|x=x_0+1] - \\mathbb{E}[y|x_0] = (\\alpha + \\beta \\times (x_0 + 1)) - (\\alpha + \\beta \\times x_0) = \\beta$.\n\n## Regression - slope coefficient interpretation\n\nSeveral good ways to interpret the slope coefficient\n\n- $y$ is $\\beta$ higher, on average, for observations with a one-unit higher value of $x$.\n- Comparing two observations that differ in $x$ by one unit, we expect $y$ to be $\\beta$ higher for the observation with one unit higher $x$.\n\nAvoid using\n\n- \"decrease/increase\" – not right, unless time series or **causal** relationship only\n- \"effect\" – not right, unless **causal** relationship\n\n## Regression: binary $x$\n\nSimplest case:\n\n- $x$ is a binary variable, zero or one.\n- $\\alpha$ is the average value of $y$ when $x$ is zero ($\\mathbb{E}[y|x=0] = \\alpha$).\n- $\\beta$ is the difference in average $y$ between observations with $x=1$ and observations with $x=0$\n  - $\\mathbb{E}[y|x=1] - \\mathbb{E}[y|x=0]= \\beta$.\n- Graphically, the regression line of linear regression goes through two points: average $y$ when $x$ is zero ($\\alpha$) and average $y$ when $x$ is one ($\\alpha + \\beta$).\n\n## Regression coefficient formula\n### Notation\n\n- Population coefficients are $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n- Sample estimates - $\\hat{\\alpha}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$ \n- The slope coefficient formula is\n  $$\\hat{\\beta} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}[x, y]}{\\text{Var}[x]} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n  $$\n\n- Slope coefficient formula is **normalized version** of the covariance between $x$ and $y$.\n\n## Regression coefficient formula\n\n- The intercept – average $y$ minus average $x$ multiplied by the estimated slope $\\hat{\\beta}$.\n$$\\hat{\\alpha} = \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta} \\bar{x}\n$$\n\n- The formula of the intercept reveals that the regression line always goes through the point of average $x$ and average y.\n\n## Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)\n\n::: columns\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n- The formulas Provided for the slope and intercept can be found using OLS (an estimation method).\n- OLS gives the **best**-fitting linear regression line.\n- It gives the best line by minimizing the squared of the model errors.\n\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {#fe94b9f7 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.stata .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\nclear \nqui:set obs 20\nqui:gen x = rnormal()+1\nqui:gen y = 1+x+rnormal()\nqui:gen yh=1+x\ntwo (scatter y x, msize(3) mcolor(gs3%50)) ///\n   (line yh x, color(navy)) (pcarrow yh x y x, color(gs9)), ///\nlegend(off)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](week05-06_files/figure-revealjs/cell-3-output-1.png){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Regression coefficient formula\n\n- Ordinary Least Squares – OLS is method used to find the best fit minimizing the Squared \"residuals\".\n\n  $$\\min_{\\alpha,\\beta} \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\alpha - \\beta x_i)^2$$\n\nFor this minimization problem, we can use calculus to give $\\hat{\\alpha}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$, the values for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ that give the minimum.

Not necessarily Causal Relations.\n  \n\n## Regression and causation - possible relations\n\n- Slope of the $\\mathbb{E}[y|x] = \\alpha + \\beta x$ regression is not zero in our data\n- Several reasons, not mutually exclusive:\n  - $x$ causes $y$: Yay!\n  - $y$ causes $x$.

(aside from non-parametric regressions)\n- Relationships between $y$ and $x$ are often complicated!\n- When and why care about the shape of a regression?\n  - When we need to talk about the non-average person.\n- How can we capture function form better?\n  - We can transform variables in a simple linear regression.\n\n## Functional form - linear approximation\n\n- Linear regression is a linear approximation to a regression of unknown shape:\n  \n- But, we may want to modify the regression to better characterize nonlinear patterns \n  - **prediction** or analyze **residuals** - better fit\n  - we want to go beyond the average pattern of association (different $x$s)\n  - all we care about is the average pattern of association, but the linear approximation is bad\n- Not care\n  - if all we care about is the average pattern of association,\n  - if linear regression is good approximation to the average pattern\n\n## Functional form - types\n\nNon linearities can be captured in many ways:\n  - Natural log transformation: $\\ln(x)$ when interested in relative differences\n  - Piecewise linear splines: For flexibility in the pattern of association \n  - Polynomials - quadratic form: Flexible yet simple\n\n## `log` transformation\n\n- Some times, some patterns are better approximated when $y$ or $x$ are measured as relative differences\n  - Particularly relevant if there is no natural base for comparison.\n- Taking the **natural logarithm** of a variable is often a good solution in such cases, because they approximate relative differences.\n\n## Logarithmic transformation - interpretation\n\n- $\\ln(x)$ or $\\log(x)$ is the natural logarithm of $x$\n  - You can only use it if $x$ is always a positive number\n  - $\\ln(0)$ or $\\ln(\\text{negative number })$ are not $Real$\n- Using this transformation, you can compare relative differences: \n$$\\ln(x + \\Delta x) - \\ln(x) \\approx \\frac{\\Delta x}{x}$$\n\n- as long as $\\Delta x$ is small.\n  - $\\ln(1.01)-\\ln(1) = 0.0099 \\approx 0.01$\n  - $\\ln(1.1)-\\ln(1) = 0.095 \\approx 0.1$\n  - but...$\\ln(1.4)-\\ln(1) = 0.336$ much less than 0.4\n\n## When to take logs?\n\n- When comparison makes mores sense in relative terms\n  - Percentage differences, relative differences, growth rates\n- Most important examples\n  - Prices\n  - Sales, turnover, GDP\n  - Population, employment\n  - Capital stock, inventories\n\n## Interpreting parameters of regressions with log variables\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n\n## log-lin model\n\n$\\ln(y^E) = \\alpha + \\beta x_i$ \n\n- log $y$, level $x$\n- $\\alpha$ is average $\\ln(y)$ when $x$ is zero. (Often meaningless.)\n- $\\beta$: $y$ is $\\beta * 100$ percent higher, on average for observations with one unit higher $x$.\n\n## lin-log model\n\n$y^E = \\alpha + \\beta\\ln(x_i)$ \n\n- level $y$, log $x$\n- $\\alpha$ is : average $y$ when $\\ln(x)$ is zero (and thus $x$ is one), not very meaningful.\n- $\\beta$: $y$ is $\\beta/100$ units higher, on average, for observations with one percent higher $x$.\n\n## log-log model\n\n$\\ln(y^E) = \\alpha + \\beta\\ln(x_i)$ \n\n- log $y$, log $x$\n- $\\alpha$: is average $\\ln(y)$ when $\\ln(x)$ is zero. (Often meaningless.)\n- $\\beta$: $y$ is $\\beta$ percent higher on average for observations with one percent higher $x$.\n  - Elasticity!\n\n## Keep in mind\n\n- Precise interpretation is key\n- The interpretation of the slope (and the intercept) coefficient(s) differs in each case!\n- Often verbal comparison is made about a **10%** difference in $x$ if using level-log or log-log regression.\n\n:::\n\n## To Take log or Not to Take log\n\nDecide for substantive reason:\n\n- Take logs if variable is likely affected in multiplicative ways\n- Don't take logs if variable is likely affected in additive ways\n\nDecide for statistical reason:\n\n- Linear regression is better at approximating average differences if distribution of dependent variable is closer to normal.\n- Take logs if skewed distribution with long right tail\n- Most often the substantive and statistical arguments are aligned\n\n## To Take log or Not to Take log\n\n- Log needs variable to be positive: Never negative, never zero\n- Sometimes you may be able to combine Logs with Dummies (if zero or negative values are present)\n- Sometimes adding a constant seems to do the trick\n  - $\\ln(x+1)$ if $x$ is positive or zero\n  - But **Not** a good solution.

Just a bit more parametric.\n- A regression with a piecewise linear spline (of $x$) results in connected line segments for the mean dependent variable,\n  - each line segment corresponding to a specific interval of the explanatory variable.\n- The points of connection are called knots,\n- The places of the knots (the boundaries of the intervals of the explanatory variable) need to be specified by the analyst.\n- **Plot-twist**: The segments need not to be linear!\n\n## Other transformations: splines\n\n- Advantage: We can interpret parameters!\n- The formula:\n\n$$y^E = \\alpha_1 + \\beta_1 x[\\text{if } $x$ < k_1] + (\\alpha_2 + \\beta_2 x)[\\text{if } k_1 \\leq $x$ \\leq k_2] + \\dots + (\\alpha_m + \\beta_m x)[\\text{if } $x$ \\geq k_{m-1}]$$\n\nBut we we usually assume that $\\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\dots, \\alpha_m = 0$ and only allow $\\beta's$ to change\n\n## Other transformations: splines\n\nInterpretation of the most important parameters\n\n- $\\alpha$: average $y$ when $x$ is zero.\n- $\\beta_1$: How much higher $y$ is, on average, for observations with one unit higher $x$ value, if $x \\in (-\\infty , k_1)$.\n- $\\beta_2$: How much higher $y$ is, on average, for observations with one unit higher $x$ value, if $x \\in (k_2, k_2)$.\n- Etc.

- guidelines\n\nStart with deciding whether you care about nonlinear patterns or not.\n\n- Linear approximation OK if focus is on an average association.\n- Transform variables for a better interpretation of the results (e.g. log), and it often makes linear regression better approximate the average association.\n- Accommodate a nonlinear pattern if our focus is\n  - on prediction,\n  - analysis of residuals,\n  - about how an association varies beyond its average.\n- Keep in mind - **simpler the better!**\n\n# See you Next Class\n\n# Messy data\nMeasurement error!  \nExtreme values! and influential observations!\nNot everything is as it seems\n\n## Data Is Messy\n\n- Clean and neat data exist only in dreams,  and textbooks\n- Data may be messy in many ways\n  - Structure, storage type differs from what we want\n  - Needs cleaning (see Chapters 1,2)\n  - Some observations are influential\n  - Variables **measured** with error \n  - Some observations may represent more individuals (Weights?)\n    \n## Extreme values \n- Some observations may contain **Extreme** values, compared to the rest of the data\n- Extreme values examples\n  - Banking sector employment share in countries. Luxembourg: 10%\n  - Hotel price of 1 US dollars, 10,000 US dollars\n  - Production of a small firm: 1,000,000,000 units\n  \n## Influential observations\n\n- Influential observations\n  - Their inclusion or exclusion **influences** the regression line (sensitivity)\n  - Influential observations are often extreme values (on $x$ or $y$)\n  - But not all extreme values are influential observations\n- Influential observations example\n  - Very large tech companies in a regression of size and average wage\n  - A single mixed-race worker in a regression\n\n## What to do with them?\n\n- Depends on why they are extreme\n- If by mistake: may want to drop them (EUR1000+) (or Impute them)\n- If by nature: don't want to drop them (Part of the distribution)\n- Grey zone: patterns work differently for them for substantive reasons\n- General rule: avoid dropping observations based on value of $y$ variable\n  - Dropping extreme observations by $x$ variable may be OK\n  - But those are valuable as they represent informative and large variation\n\n## Measurement Errors In Variables\n\n- Goal: measuring the association between variables\n  - Furthermore, we are interested in the estimated value (not just the sign)\n- But, observed variables have measurement error\n  - Mistake, hard-to-measure data, created variables\n- Often cannot do anything about it!\n- So, what the consequence is of such errors??\n- Does the answer depend on the type of measurement error?\n\n## Classical Measurement Error\n\n$$w = w^* + \\varepsilon$$\n\n1. is zero on average (so it does not affect the average of the measured variable) and\n2. is independent of all other relevant variables, including the error-free variable.\n\n- Recording errors: E.g., due to mistakes in entering data\n- Reporting errors: in surveys or administrative data If they are random around the true quantities\n\n## CME in the dependent variable ($y$)\n\nConsider $y = y^* + e$, where $y$ is the measured variable, $y^*$ is the error-free variable, and $e$ is the measurement error (noise). \n\nThe slope coefficient of $y$ and $y^*$ on $x$ are:\n\n$$\\beta^* = \\frac{\\text{Cov}[y^*, x]}{\\text{Var}[x]} \\text{ and } \\beta = \\frac{\\text{Cov}[y^* + e, x]}{\\text{Var}[x]}\n$$\n\n$$\\beta = \\frac{\\text{Cov}[y^*, x]}{\\text{Var}[x]} + \\left(\\frac{\\text{Cov}[e, x]}{\\text{Var}[x]}\\approx  0\\right) \\approx \\beta^*  \n$$\n\n- **Consequence**: classical measurement error in $y$ is not expected to affect the regression coefficients.\n\n## CME in the explanatory variable ($x$)\n\nConsider $x = x^* + e$, where $x$ is the measured variable, $x^*$ is the error-free variable, and $e$ is the measurement error (noise). \n\nThe slope coefficient are:\n$$\\beta^* = \\frac{\\text{Cov}[y, x^*]}{\\text{Var}[x^*]} \\text{ and } \\beta = \\frac{\\text{Cov}[y, x^*+e]}{\\text{Var}[x^*+e]}\n$$\n\n$$\\beta = \\frac{\\text{Cov}[y, x^*]+(\\text{Cov}[y, e]\\approx 0)}{\\text{Var}[x^*]+\\text{Var}[e]} = \\beta^* \\frac{\\text{Var}[x^*]}{\\text{Var}[x^*]+\\text{Var}[e]}\n$$\n\n- **Consequence**: CME in $x$ will affect the regression coefficients. (Towards zero) **Attenuation Bias**\n- $\\alpha$ is also affected\n\n\n## Classical measurement error in the explanatory variable ($x$)\n\n- Noise to signal ratio is: $\\frac{\\text{Var}[e]}{\\text{Var}[x^*]}$\n  - How much noise is there compared to the true variation $x*$\n- When the noise-to-signal ratio is low, we may safely ignore the problem.\n  - this happens often when\n    - when we are confident that recording errors are at not important\n    - when our data has an aggregate variable estimated from very large samples.\n- When the noise-to-signal ratio is substantial\n  - we may be better of assessing its consequences.\n\n## Extra: non-classical measurement error\n\n- In real-life data measurement error in variables may or may not be classical\n  - Very often, it isn't!\n- Variables measured with error may be less dispersed (non-zero mean)\n  - Example: Self reported Income\n- Measurement error may be related to variables of interest\n  - Example: Self-reported weight and height\n- This often means that modelling needs to be redesigned\n\n## Classical measurement error summary\n\n1. CME in the dependent ($y$) variable is not expected to affect the regression coefficients.\n2. CME in the explanatory ($x$) variable will affect the regression coefficients.\n   1. The estimated beta will be closer to zero than it would be without measurement error.\n3. Almost all variables are measured with error. Need to think about consequences.\n\n## Hotel ratings and measurement error\n\n- Review the case of Ratings and Prices of hotels\n  - Average customer ratings are noisy and bad proxies for the true quality of a hotel.\n  - The true quality of a hotel is unobserved.\n- Regressions for hotels with few ratings are likely to produce attenuated slope coefficients.\n- And that is what you can find!\n  - I would argue the same with Amazon reviews\n- But what to do? \n  - perhaps Robustness checks. Restrict regressions to cases with different levels of Measurement error.\n\n## Using weights in regressions\n\n- Different observations may have different weights (importance or size)\n  - to denote different size of larger units in the data\n  - population of countries\n- Use weights of size IF want to uncover the patterns of association for the **individuals**\n  - who make up the larger units (e.g., people in countries),\n- Also, use weights when you want your data to be representative of the population\n  - when you want to generalize the results to the population\n\n## Life expectancy and GDP per capita - weights\n\n::: {#121a300e .cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.stata .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\nqui: reg lifeexp log_gdp [w=population ]\npredict life_hatw\nqui: reg lifeexp log_gdp \npredict life_hatnw\n*p*redict life_hat\ntwo (scatter lifeexp gdppc [w=population ],  color(%50)) ///\n(scatter lifeexp gdppc [w=population ] if inlist(countryname,\"China\",\"India\",\"United States\"),  color(%50) mlabel(countryname)) ///\n(line life_hatw life_hatnw gdppc,sort  ), scale(1.4) legend(off) ///\nytitle(Life Expectancy) xtitle(GDP per capita) ///\nxscale(log) xlabel(1 2 5 10 25 50 100)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n(option xb assumed; fitted values)\n(option xb assumed; fitted values)\n(analytic weights assumed)\n(analytic weights assumed)\n(analytic weights assumed)\n(analytic weights assumed)\n(analytic weights assumed)\n(analytic weights assumed)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](week05-06_files/figure-revealjs/cell-14-output-2.png){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Summary take-away\n\n- Nonlinear functional forms may or may not be important for regression analysis.\n- They are usually important for prediction.\n- less important for causal analysis.\n- When important, we have multiple options: Logs, splines, polynomials\n- Influential observations and other extreme values are usually best analyzed with the rest of the data \n- Discard them only if you have a good reason.\n\n# Regression Analysis III\nGeneralizing Regression Results\nHypothesis Testing 2.0\n\n# Regressions and Statistical Inference\n\n## Generalizing: reminder\n\n- We have uncovered some pattern in our data.

Feasible generalized least squares (FGLS)\n  - Huber-White robust standard errors\n- Traditionally, you also want to test if you have a Heteroskedasticity problem\n  - White test, Breusch-Pagan test\n\nBut for now lets assume you have a heteroskedasticity problem\n\n## Heteroskedasticity Robust SE\n\n- White-Huber Robust SE is correct with and without heteroskedasticity.\n- Same properties as before: smaller when $Std[e]$ is small, $Std[x]$ is large and $n$ is large\n- Mathematically, Huber-White SE \"corrects\" the simple SE using the residuals from the regression.\n$$Var_r(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\frac{\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^2 \\hat e_i^2}{\\left(\\sum (x_i-\\bar x)^2\\right)^2}$$\n\n**Note:** there are many heteroskedastic-robust formula: 'HC0', 'HC1', 'HC2', 'HC3'. `Stata` uses HC1 when you ask for robust SE: `regress y x, robust`\n\n## Anythings else?\n\n- Nope\n  - Coefficient and $R^2$ remain the same\n- Just make sure you are using `robust` SE.\n- SE may be similar, but most likely larger than the simple SE\n\n## Testing if (true) beta is zero\n\n- Testing hypotheses: decide if a statement about a general pattern is true.\n- The question: are the Dependent variable and the explanatory variable related at all?\n- The null and the alternative:\n$$H_0: \\beta_{true} = 0, H_A: \\beta_{true} \\neq 0$$\n\n- The t-statistic is:\n$$t = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta} - 0}{SE(\\hat{\\beta})}$$\n\n- Often $t = 2$ (1.96) is the critical value, which corresponds to 95% CI. or 5% significance level ($\\alpha$) $(t = 2.6 \\rightarrow 99\\%)$\n\n## Testing if (true) beta is zero\n\nPractical guidance, Same as before!:\n\n- Choose a critical value.\n  - p-value, the probability of a false positive in our dataset\n  - Balancing act: false positive (FP) and negative (FN)\n- Higher critical value\n  - FP: less likely (less likely rejection of the null).\n  - FN: more likely (high risk of not rejecting a null even though it's false)\n- Typical critical values: 5% (1.96) \n\n## Ohh, that $p=5\\%$ cutoff\n\n- When testing, you start with a critical value first\n- Often the standard to publish a result is to have a p value below 5%.\n  - Arbitrary, but...there is lots of discussion about it.\n- If you find a result that cannot be told apart from 0 at 1% (max 5%), you should say that explicitly.\n  - Sometimes that is what you want to say. A non-significant result is also a result.\n\n## Dealing with 5-10%\n\n- Sometimes regression result may be significant at 10%.\n- What not to do? Avoid language like...\n  - \"a barely detectable statistically significant difference\" ($p=0.073$)\n  - \"a margin at the edge of significance\" ($p=0.0608$)\n- Sometimes you work on a proposal: **Proof of concept**.\n  - To be lenient is okay. You may need more power!\n  - Say the point estimate and note the 95% confidence interval.\n- Sometimes you are looking for a proof. Beyond reasonable doubt.\n  - Here you wanna be below 1% (or less)\n  - Be honest...present the p-value, and the CI.\n\n## p-Hacking\n\n- Just as before. Be honest. Do not fixate on the 5% level.\n\nSuggestion:\n\n- Present your most conservative result first\n  - Example: if uncertain, keep extreme values in.\n- Show robustness checks: many additional regressions with different decisions\n\n## Chance Events And Size of Data\n\n- Some times you just need more power.\n- Finding patterns by chance may go away with more observations\n- Specificities to a single dataset may be less important if more sources\n- More observations help only if\n  - Errors and idiosyncrasies affect some observations but not all\n  - Additional observations are from appropriate source\n  - If worried about specificities of Vienna more observations from Vienna would not help\n\n# Prediction and Uncertainty\n\n## Prediction uncertainty\n\n- **Goal:** predicting the value of $y$ for observations outside the dataset, when only the value of $x$ is known.\n- We predict $y$ based on coefficient estimates, which are relevant in the general pattern/population. With linear regression you have a simple model:\n$$y_i = \\hat{\\alpha} + \\hat{\\beta}x_i + \\epsilon_i\n$$\n\n- The estimated statistic here is a predicted value for a particular observation $\\hat{y}_j$. For an observation $j$ with known value $x_j$ this is\n$$\\hat{y}_j = \\hat{\\alpha} + \\hat{\\beta}x_j$$\n\n## Prediction uncertainty\n\n- You can produce two kinds of intervals:\n  - Confidence interval for the predicted value/regression line\n    - Uncertainty comes from $\\hat{\\alpha}, \\hat{\\beta}$\n  - Prediction interval, uncertainty comes from $\\hat{\\alpha}, \\hat{\\beta}$ and $\\epsilon_i$\n\n## Confidence interval of the regression line I.\n\n- The predicted value $\\hat{y}_j$ is based on $\\hat{\\alpha}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$ only.\n  - Thus, the CI of the predicted value combines the CI for $\\hat{\\alpha}$ and the CI for $\\hat{\\beta}$.\n- What to expect if we know the value of $x_j$ and $\\hat{\\alpha}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$?.\n\n  $$95\\%CI(\\hat{y}_j) = \\hat{y_j} \\pm 1.96 SE(\\hat{y}_j)$$\n\n- The standard error of the predicted value is\n  $$SE(\\hat{y}_j) = \\frac{Std[e]}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}+ \\frac{(x_j - \\bar{x})^2}{nVar[x]}}}\n  $$\n\n- Use robust SE formula in practice, but a simple formula is instructive  \n\n## Prediction interval\n\n- Prediction interval answers:\n  - Where to expect the particular $y_j$ value if we know the corresponding $x_j$ value and the estimates of the regression coefficients?\n- The **CI** of the predicted value is about $\\hat{y}_j$: Where would the average value of the dependent variable be if we know $x_j$.\n- The **PI** (prediction interval) is about $y_j$ itself not its average value, what range of values we expect for  $y_j$ if we know $x_j$.\n- So PI starts with CI. But adds additional uncertainty ($Std[\\epsilon_i]$) that actual $y_j$ will be around its conditional.\n\n## Prediction interval\n\n- The formula for the 95% prediction interval is\n  - $95\\%PI(\\hat{y}_j) = \\hat{y} \\pm 1.96SPE(\\hat{y}_j)$\n  - $SPE(\\hat{y}_j) = Std[e]\\sqrt{\\textbf{1} + \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x_j - \\bar{x})^2}{nVar[x]}}$\n- SPE – Standard Prediction Error (SE of prediction)\n- Summarizes the additional uncertainty: the actual $y_j$ value is expected to be spread around its average value.\n  - This is best estimated by the standard deviation of the residual $e$.\n- In the formula, all elements get very small if $n$ gets large, except for the new element.\n\n## Prediction interval\n\n::: {#d6edaf32 .cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.stata .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\nqui:ssc install frause,\nqui:frause oaxaca, clear\nqui: drop if runiform()<.8 \nqui: sort age\nqui: reg lnwage age\nqui: predict lnwage_hat\nqui: predict se_ci, stdp\nqui: predict se_pi, stdf\nqui: gen ci_low = lnwage_hat - 1.96*se_ci\nqui: gen ci_up = lnwage_hat + 1.96*se_ci\nqui: gen pi_low = lnwage_hat - 1.96*se_pi\nqui: gen pi_up = lnwage_hat + 1.96*se_pi\ntwoway  (rarea pi_low pi_up age, color(gs5%25) ) ///\n(rarea ci_low ci_up age, color(gs5%25) ) ///\n       (scatter lnwage age, color(navy)) (line lnwage_hat age, color(navy)) ///\n       , legend(off) ytitle(Log Wages) xtitle(Age)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](week05-06_files/figure-revealjs/cell-15-output-1.png){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# External validity\n\n## External validity\n\n- Statistical inference helps us generalize to the population or general pattern\n- Is this true beyond the data (other dates, countries, people, firms)?\n  - we can't assess it using our data.\n- We'll never really know.

It's used for both causal and predictive analysis.\n\n2. **Coefficient Interpretation**: In linear regression, the intercept and slope have specific meanings, indicating the expected values and changes in the dependent variable relative to the explanatory variable.\n\n3. **Non-linear Relationships**: Non-linear patterns can be captured using non-parametric methods and transformations like logs and splines. Depends on the goal of the analysis.\n\n4. **Data Challenges**: Real-world data issues like measurement errors and extreme values can affect regression results. Analysts must carefully manage these challenges.\n\n5. **Generalization and Inference**: Statistical inference helps generalize findings beyond the sample, but external validity requires additional data and context.\n\n## Reading-Homework\n\nRead [Case Study](CaseStudy_SLR.qmd) as an example of a simple linear regression analysis.\n\n",
