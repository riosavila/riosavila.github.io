Find that **Causal** effect.\n    -   Caveat: We may not have the best data for this, but we can come up with cleaver designs to still do our job!\n\n## Where does Econometric Fits in Empirical Research\n\n### Obvious answer\n\n-   You will need **Econometrics methods** to analyze your data, however, (just as a reminder) you should be aware of \"HOW\" an Empirical Research should be made:\n\n**S1.** Research Question:\n\n-   A question that is Answerable (within bounderies of Time/Money/and availabilty)\n-   That should help us understand a Topic Better\n-   That is Specific Enough to be feasible, but General Enough to be of interest.\n    -   Keep it simple\n\n## Where does Econometric Fits in Empirical Research\n\n**S2.** Construct an Economic model\n\n-   To understand what the problem before you start analyzing the research question. May not need a formal modeling (Heavy Math), but enough to have some understanding of the problem.\n\n**S3.** Decide on the Econometric model\n\n-   You need to decide what data is needed and is available your **model**.\n-   How you will estimate the model (assumptions on methods)\n\n**S4.** Estimate model, and Analyze Data\n\n-   Estimate the model, using Economtric tools and Methods fitted to the **data** and the research question.\n-   Explain results in light of your Economic Model, and theoretical predictions. The Economist in you!\n\n## So you need **Data**\n\n![](images/paste-2.png)\n\n## Need for Data\n\nDifferent types of data may allow for using different econometric methodologies, and answer different types of questions.\n\n-   Keep in mind you will only have access to **SAMPLES**, never the **Population**\n\n-   There will be instances that you come **close** to Population data, ie Census.\n\n-   But Even Census data is not the Population (or Super Population we use in Econometrics).\n\n## Types of Data:\n\n**Cross-Section**: Sample of the population collects data on **Many** individuals in a single point in time.\n\n**Time Series Data**: Data collected on a **single** individual across time.\n\n**Panel Data**: Data collected for **Many** individuals who are followed across time.\n\n**Repeated Cross-Section**: Pooled ***Cross-Section Data*** for different individuals collected at different points in time. Individuals are not followed across time.\n\n## Visually\n\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Crossection\n\n![](images/ch1_1.png)\n\n## Time Series\n\n![](images/ch1_2.png)\n\n## Panel Data\n\n![](images/ch1_3.png)\n\n## Repeated Crossection\n\n![](images/ch1_4.png)\n:::\n\n## Before the Break:\n\n### Causality, Ceteris Paribus, and Counterfactuals\n\nThee important concepts for the Class\n\n-   **Causality**: This is what most applied research aims to identify. A **causal effect** is a change the variable interest experiences, only because a second variable **changed**, while all other factors remained FIXED.\n\n    -   This is different from associations or correlations.\n\n-   **Ceteris Paribus**: In Econometric analysis, *ceteris paribus* implies that all factors, except the one analyzed, are assumed constant (There is no change), thus leading to causality\n\n-   **Counterfactual**: It is the consideration of what would have been if only a single factor changed in the analysis (for a given observation).\n\n    -   What if didn't apply to the MSC at Levy? If you got miss your plane to the US? etc.\n\n## Thinking about Counterfactuals is Key\n\nFor empirical work that aims to identify Causal Effects, it is important to understand the concept of counterfactual.\n\n-   It will help you understand what is what you need to analyze,\n-   How could those effects be identified in ideal scenarios (Experiments)\n-   What the limitation of those scenarios are\n-   And what alternatives are there to void those limitations\n\n## Example: Causal effect of Fertilizer on Crops\n\nRQ: By how much will the **production** of soybeans increase if one increases the amount of **fertilizer** applied to the ground?\n\nCF: Same Piece of Land with and without Fertilizer (Impossible)\n\nEXP: Randomly Use Fertilizers Across different Plots of Land (Expensive but feasible)\n\nEA: Use *Regressions* to ***keep*** other all factors that can affect Land productivity fixed when Analyzing Expost Data (Inexpensive)\n\n## Example: Causal Effect of Smoking on Babie's health\n\nRQ: Does Smoking during Pregnancy decreases birthweight?\n\nCF: We consider the same woman. In one case she smokes through pregnancy, in the other she doesnt. Compare Babies Weight.\n\nEXP: Select a random sample of Pregnant Women and randomly select those who will be \"forced\" to smoke during pregnancy.\n\nEXP1: Select a Randome sample of PW with history of smoking. Randomly offer them a voucher and Counceling to quit smoking.\n\nEA: Consider women with similar characteristics, except for smoking, and compare their babies outcomes.\n\n## Homework 0\n\nRead Chapter 2 of -The Effect- by Nick Hungtington-Klein. [here](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-ResearchQuestions.html)\n\nIn groups of X:\n\n- Come up with a Research question, \n- Identify your main dependent variable, and the variable you want to analyze the *causal effect*.\n- Describe relevant factors that may need to be considered for the analysis (Economic model).\n- Describe how those factors may relate to the outcome, and your variable of interest.\n- Describe an ideal *Experiment* you may run to identify the effect. Is it a feasible experiment?\n- Is there any data you could use to answer this question? \n\n",
