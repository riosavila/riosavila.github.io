(Window of time if fixed)\n\n    -   You have access to a single \"random\" time line\n\n-   And in time series, one needs to be quite aware that Data has Baggage...What you see today is the product of everything that happens in the far past.\n\n-   This is what we call Past Dependent, or simple serial correlation.\n\n    -   And is why we need to be careful when we use time series data.\n\n## The nature of time series data\n\n-   Data cannot not be arbitrarily reordered. (Past affect future)\n\n    -   Typical features: serial correlation/nonindependence of observations\n\n-   Randomness of the data comes from the uncertainty of shocks that affects a variable over time, not from sampling.\n\n-   Your \"Sample\" is one realized path that you observe in a narrow window of time.\n\n-   Because observations are no longer independent, we will need to worry about correlation across time.\n\n-   In fact, because data may be strongly correlated across time (say your age), it may generate some problems when applying OLS.\n\n    -   Highly correlated data (high innertia) will have common \"trends\" that do not necessarity reflect the causal relationship between variables.\n\n-   So, we must learn \"new\" tools to deal with this problem.\n\n# Basic TS models\n\n## 1: Static model\n\n-   The static model is the simplest model for analyzing time series data. (like SLRM)\n-   A Static model aims to find correlations between contemporaneous variables.\n    -   Implicity, this **assumes** there are no dynamic interactions among variables\n\n$$GDP_t = a_0 + a_1 educ_t + a_2 Invest_t + a_3 Unemp_t + u_t$$\n\nEducation, investment and Unemployment rate are assumed to affect GDP contemporaneously. But Lags of Leads of the data has no effect on GDP.\n\n-   These models are not useful for Forecasting, and Only produces reasonable estimates under very strong assumptions (we will see this later).\n\n## 2: Finite Distributed Lag model (FDL)\n\n-   The FDL model is a simple extension of the static model that allows for dynamic interactions of independent variables.\n    -   ***Finite*** Because we choose How far back (lags) to add to the model\n    -   ***Distributed*** Because each lag will have a different effect on the dependent variable.\n-   Simple Example: $$fr_t = a_0 + a_1 te_t +e_t$$ $$fr_t = a_0 + a_1 te_t + a_2 te_{t-1}+ a_3 te_{t-2}+e_t$$\n\n$fr_t$: Fertility Rate; $te_t$: Tax exemption\n\nThis is an FDL model with 2 lags.\n\n## \n\n-   More Generality, FDL of order **q** is defined as:\n\n$$y_t = a_0 + \\sum_{k=0}^q \\delta_k z_{t-k} + e_t$$\n\n-   You can choose Lags using F-statistic, but also considering the \"loss\" of Degrees of freedom.\n    -   More lags, less data to estimate the coefficients, more coefficients to estimate\n    -   Coefficients may suffer from High Collinearity\n    -   Allow us to draw inference on Duration of effects.\n-   Two Types of Effects:\n    -   Transitory effects $\\frac{\\partial y_t}{\\partial z_{t-q}}=\\delta_q$\n    -   Permanent effect $\\frac{\\partial y_t}{\\partial z}=\\sum \\frac{\\partial y_t}{\\partial z_{t-q}}=\\sum \\delta_k$\n\n## \n### What do you expect to see?\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Transitory](images/paste-11.png)\n\n![Permanent](images/paste-12.png)\n\n:::\n\n- **Transitory** effects measure the short-term effect on outcome (Only of the additional unit)\n- **Permanent** effects measure the long-term effect on outcome (adding up Transitory effects)\n\n## 3: Infinite Distributed Lag model (IDL)\n\n- This is a more advanced model that allows for the effects of independent variables to last forever, but how?\n  - A model with infinite number of lags cannot be estimated...unless some restrictions are imposed.\n\n$$ \\text{Wrong: } y_t = a_0 + \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\delta_k z_{t-k} + e_t$$\n$$ \\text{Better: } y_t = a_0 + \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma \\delta^k z_{t-k} + e_t$$\n\n- So we went from pretending to estimate an infinite number of coefficients $\\delta_k$ to estimating only two parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$. \n    - This is called the **Geometric Distributed Lag** model.\n\n##\n\n- GDL requires an additional \"Trick\":\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\ny_t &= a_0 + \\gamma z_t + \\gamma \\rho z_{t-1} + \\dots + e_t \\\\\ny_{t-1} &= a_0 + \\gamma z_{t-1} + \\gamma \\rho z_{t-2} + \\dots + e_{t-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n- Subtracting the second equation (times $\\rho$ ) from the first one, we get:\n  \n$$y_t =  \\rho y_{t-1} + a_0 (1-\\rho) + \\gamma z_t  + v_{t}$$\n\nWhich requires really strong assumptions!\n\n- The short and Long effects are:\n\n$$\\text{Short}\\frac{\\partial y_t}{\\partial z_{t-k}}=\\gamma \\rho^k \\text{ and }\n\\text{Long}\\frac{\\partial y_t}{\\partial z}=\\frac{\\gamma}{1-\\rho}$$\n\n\n## 4: Rational Distributed Lag model (RDL)\n\n- Because IDL imposes strong assumptions on coefficients, we can relax them by allowing for lags. This is called the RDL model.\n$$y_t = a_0 + \\gamma_0 z_t + \\gamma_1 z_t  +\\delta y_{t-1} + e_t- \\rho e_{t-1}$$\n\n- Which has the following short and long effects:\n\n$$\\text{ Short:}\\frac{\\partial y_t}{\\partial z_t} = \\gamma_0  $$\n$$\\text{ Short:}\\frac{\\partial y_t}{\\partial z_{t-k}} = \\rho^{k-1}(\\rho \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1) $$\n$$\\text{ Long:}\\frac{\\partial y_t}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1}{1-\\rho}$$\n\n# Assumptions\nAt least for M1 and M2\n\n## Assumptions: M1 and M2\n\n1. Linear in Parameters: Same old, same old, $y_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1t} + \\dots + \\beta_k x_{kt} + u_t$\n\n2. No Perfect Collinearity: Also Same old, same old \n\n## \n### The Stronger ones\n\n$$X=\\begin{pmatrix}\nx_{11} & x_{12} & \\dots & x_{1k} \\\\\nx_{21} & x_{22} & \\dots & x_{2k} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nx_{T1} & x_{T2} & \\dots & x_{Tk} \n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n3. Zero Conditional Mean\n\n$$E(u_t|X)=0$$\n\nSo that $X$ is strictly Exogenous (across all possible times)\n\n",
