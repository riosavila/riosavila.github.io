People will either be treated or untreated, not both.\n\nSo what can we do?\n\n> **We need to find good counterfactuals!**\n\nThis means finding people are very similar to the ones treated, so they can be used as the examples of the \"what if\" question.\n\nBut there is a problem. Even in the best scenarios, we can never be asure about how to control for unobservables...or can we?\n\n## \n\n- **You can always RCT** But it can be expensive\n\n- **You can IV the problem** but its hard to justify\n\n- **You can add FE**, but you have time varying errors\n\nThen what?\n\n- You could RDD the problem (if you have the right data!)\n\n## What is RDD?\n\n**RDD** or Regression Discontinuity design is methodology that is known for its clean identification and with a relatively easy visualization tool to understand the identification, and solve the problem of unobserved distributions. (see [here](https://academic.oup.com/qje/advance-article/doi/10.1093/qje/qjad011/7068116?login=true) for a recent paper on how to make graphs on this).\n\nIn fact, the treatment Status has a very clear Rule!\n\nConsider the following problem: \n\n1. You want to study the role of college on earnings.\n2. You have data on people who are applying to go to school. They all take some standardized tests. Their grade will determine if they get into College or not.\n3. People with high skills will get a higher grades in the GRE, go to college, and probably get higher salaries. \n4. But, there is a problem. How can you figure out if wages are due to College or skill?\n\n## Possible Solution\n\nSay that we actually have access to the grades, which range from 100 to 200. And assume that you say, every one with grades higher than 170 will go to college. \n\nCan you estimate the effect now?\n\n- You can't compare people with more than 170 to those with less than 170. Because skill or ability will be different across groups.\n- However, what if you compare individuals with 170-172 vs 167-169? \n  - These individuals are so close togeter they problably have very similar characteristics as well! \n  - you have a Localized randomization.\n\nIn this case, your analysis is those individuals just above the thresholds to those just below (counterfactual)\n\nUnless you think grades near the threshold are as good as random, then you have a design to identify treatment effects!\n\n## RDD: How it works.\n\n**Selection and Index**:\n\n1. The first thing you need to see if you can use and RDD is to see if you have access to a variable that \"ranks\" units.\n   \n  - This variable should be smooth and preferibly continuous.\n    - age, distance from boarder, test score, poverty index\n  \n2. Assignment into treatment is a function of this index only, with a clear threshold for the index to have an impact the treatment.\n  \n  - Those under the Threshold are not treated. Those above are.\n  - This is called a **Sharp RDD** design.\n\n## \n\n3. The threshold should be unique to the Treatment of interest (nothing else happens around that point) \n  \n  - In the College Case, we assume 170 triggers acceptance to School. But if it also triggers Scholarships??\n  \n4. Perhaps the Most important: The score cannot be manipulated\n   \n   - Only then we have true local randomization. \n\n5. You want the potential outcomes to be smooth functions of Z. (so we do not mix treatment effects with Nonsmooth changes in outcomes)\n\n## Sharp RDD    \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.stata .cell-code}\nclear\nset scheme white2\ncolor_style bay\nset seed 1\nqui:set obs 100\ngen e=rnormal()\ngen z=runiform()+e\ngen t = z>0\ngen y = 1 + z + e + rnormal() + (z>0)\ntwo line t z, sort title(\"Treatment\") ylabel(0 \"Not Treated\" 1 \"Treated\") name(m1, replace) ytitle(\"\")\ngraph export resources\\rdd1.png,  width(1000) height(1000) replace\ntwo scatter y z, sort title(\"Outcome\") pstyle(p1) || lfit y z, lw(1) pstyle(p2) ///\n\t|| lfit y z if z<0, lw(0.5) || lfit y z if z>0, lw(0.5) , legend(off) name(m2, replace)\ngraph export resources\\rdd2.png,  width(1000) height(1000)  replace\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: { layout-ncol=2}\n\n![ ](resources/rdd1.png)\n\n![ ](resources/rdd2.png)\n\n:::\n\n## How it works : p2\n\nRecall that in an RCT (or under randomization) treatment effects are estimated by comparing those treated and those not treated.\n\n$$E(y|D=1)-E(y|D=0)$$\n\nUnder SRDD, you can also think about the same experiment, except that we would need to compare individuals AT the theshold.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\lim_{z\\downarrow c} E(y|Z=z) &- \\lim_{z\\uparrow c} E(y|Z=z) \\\\\nE(y(1)|Z=c) &-E(y(0)|Z=c)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n- In this case, the overlapping assumption is violated. So we need to attemp obtaining effects for groups AT the limit when $Z=c$.\n\n## Estimation\n\nThe most simple way to proceed is to estimate the model using a parametric approach (OLS)\n\n$$y = a_0 + \\delta D_{z>c} + f(z-c) + e$$\n\nThe idea here is to identify a \"jump\" in the outcome (treatment effect) at the point where $z$ crosses the threshold. \n\nBut to identify the jump only, we also need to model the trend observe before and after that threshold ($f(z-c)$), which can be modelled as flexible as possible.\n(this include interactions with the jump)\n\nAlternatively, we could use smaller bandwidths (nonparametric)\n\n## Example\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.stata .cell-code}\n qui: {\nclear\nset seed 1\nset obs 200\ngen e=rnormal()\ngen z=runiform()+e\nsum z\nreplace z=(z-r(mean))/r(sd)\ngen t = z>0\ngen y = 1 + 0.5*z + e + rnormal() + (z>0)\n\nqui:reg y t z \npredict yh1\nlocal b1:display %3.2f _b[t]\nqui:reg y t c.z##c.z  \npredict yh2\nlocal b2:display %3.2f _b[t]\nqui:reg y t c.z##c.z##c.z\npredict yh3\nlocal b3:display %3.2f _b[t]\nsort z\n}\ntwo (scatter y z, sort title(\"Sharp RDD\") pstyle(p1) color(%20)) ///\n\t(line yh1 z if z<0, pstyle(p2) lw(0.5)) (line yh1 z if z>0, pstyle(p2) lw(0.5)) ///\n\t(line yh2 z if z<0, pstyle(p3) lw(0.5)) (line yh2 z if z>0, pstyle(p3) lw(0.5)) ///\n\t(line yh3 z if z<0, pstyle(p4) lw(0.5)) (line yh3 z if z>0, pstyle(p4) lw(0.5)) , ///\n\tlegend(order(2 \"Linear ATT: `b1'\" 3 \"Quadratic ATT: `b2'\" 4 \"Cubic ATT: `b3'\")) name(m1, replace)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](11rdd_files/figure-pdf/cell-3-output-1.png){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Example\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.stata .cell-code}\nqui: {\nqui:reg y t c.z#t \npredict yh11\nlocal b1:display %3.2f _b[t]\nqui:reg y t (c.z##c.z)#t  \npredict yh21\nlocal b2:display %3.2f _b[t]\nqui:reg y t (c.z##c.z##c.z)#t\npredict yh31\nlocal b3:display %3.2f _b[t]\n}\ntwo (scatter y z, sort title(\"Sharp RDD\") pstyle(p1) color(%20)) ///\n\t(line yh11 z if z<0, pstyle(p2) lw(0.5)) (line yh11 z if z>0, pstyle(p2) lw(0.5)) ///\n\t(line yh21 z if z<0, pstyle(p3) lw(0.5)) (line yh21 z if z>0, pstyle(p3) lw(0.5)) ///\n\t(line yh31 z if z<0, pstyle(p4) lw(0.5)) (line yh31 z if z>0, pstyle(p4) lw(0.5)) , ///\n\tlegend(order(2 \"Linear ATT: `b1'\" 3 \"Quadratic ATT: `b2'\" 4 \"Cubic ATT: `b3'\"))\tname(m2, replace) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](11rdd_files/figure-pdf/cell-4-output-1.png){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Fuzzy RD: Imperfect compliance\n\nWhile the Idea Scenario happens when there is perfect compliance (above the threshold you are treated), this doesnt happen all the time.\n\nIn the education example: \n\n- Some people with low grades may be \"legacy\" or have \"contacts\" (or took a second exam later) and manage to go to college\n- Some decided not to go, even after entering to college\n\nSounds Familiar? (Never takers vs always takers)\n\nWhen this happens, you can still do RDD, but you need more steps\n\n## Fuzzy RD\n\n1. Estimate the impact of Discontinuity on Treatment\n2. Estimate the impact of Discontinuity on Outcome\n3. Estimate the ratio between (1) and (2)\n\nSounds Familiar?\n\n- Its a kind of wald/IV estimator. \n  - The instrument is the discontinuity\n  - The the endogenous variable is the treament\n  \nYou still need to estimate the effect as close to the Discontinuity as possible\n\n`ivregress` may still do most of this for you\n\n## Example {.scrollable}\n\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2 }\n\n![Treatment](resources/frdd1.png)\n\n![Outcome](resources/frdd2.png)\n\n:::\n\nEffect: \n\n``` {.stata .cell-code}\nqui: gen dz = z>0\nqui: reg y dz c.z##c.z#i.dz\nlocal b1 = _b[dz]\nqui: reg t dz c.z##c.z#i.dz\nlocal b2 = _b[dz]\n\ndisplay \"There is a \" %3.2f `b1' \" effect on the outcome\"\ndisplay \"and a \" %3.2f `b2' \" effect on the treatment\"\ndisplay \"which imply a LATE of \" %3.2f `=`b1'/`b2''\n```\nThere is a 0.45 effect on the outcome\nand a 0.44 effect on the treatment\nwhich imply a LATE of 1.03\n\n\n## Things to consider\n\n**Theoretical**:\n\n1. You need to identify \"jumps\" caused by a running variable. (depends on knowing how things works)\n2. The potential outcomes have to be smooth functions of the running variable\n   \n**Empirical**:\n\n3. The running variable shouldnt be manipulated. (random)\n   - Implies Assignment rules are not known, are exogenous, and there is no random heaping\n4. Controls should be balanced around the threshold\n\n## Testing Empirical Assumptions {.scrollable}\n\nManipulation of running variable may cause a non-smooth density in the running variable:\n\n- If there is no manipulation, you may expect density round threshold to be smooth.\n  - In Stata: ssc install `rddensity`. In r install.packages(c('rdd','rddensity'))\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.stata .cell-code code-fold=\"true\"}\nset linesize 100\nqui:ssc install  lpdensity, replace\nqui:ssc install  rddensity, replace\nrddensity z, c(0) plot\ngraph export resources\\frdd3.png, width(1000) replace\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](resources/frdd3.png)\n\n## \n\n- In cases of nonrandom heaping, it may be possible to avoid the problem by restricting the data.\n\n- This is an example of measurement error, when individuals may \"round-up/down\" answers. And may occure near threshold.\n\n- This does not necessarily mean there is manipulation. \n\n- Possible Solution? Estimate RDD excluding observations around (excluding) threshold.\n\n## Covariate balance and Placebo tests\n\n- If treatment is **locally** randomized, then covariates should not be affected by discontinuity. \n\n- Alternatively, one could estimate effects on variables you know CANNOT be affected by the treatment\n\n- One could also implement a placebo test, checking the impact on a different threholds.  \n  - No effect should be observed on the outcome, (but some on the treatment)\n\n## Example \n\nImpact of Scores on Scholarship recipiency\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n```
