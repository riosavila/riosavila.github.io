However, under the ***small*** assumption that $X$ and $\\varepsilon$ are unrelated, if we would have access to the population data, we could instead consider the Conditional Expectation function (CEF):\n\n$$\nE(y_i|X_i=x) = \\int t f_y(t|X_i=x)dx\n$$\n\n-   Notice that this implies a fully **non-parametric** estimation of the Linear function (because it does not impose any functional form).\n\n-   With this, we can \"decompose\" the outcome $y$ into two components, one that depends on observation characteristics (CEF) and one that depends on the error $\\varepsilon$.\n\n$$\ny = E(y|X) + \\varepsilon\n$$\n\n-   This has the nice property that the error is unrelated to any functional form of $X$, while providing a summary of the relationship between $X$ and $y$.\n\n##  {.scrollable}\n\n-   The CEF is a convenient abstract, but to estimate it, we require assumptions. (Recall the assumptions for unbiased OLS?)\n\n-   Namely, we need to impose a linearity assumption, namely:\n\n$$\nE(y_i|X_i=x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 +\\beta_2 x_2 + ... + \n\\beta_k x_k = X_i'\\beta \n$$\n\n-   And the solution for $\\beta$ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\beta = \\underset{b}{arg} \\ E(L(y_i-X'_i b))\n$$\n\nWhere the loss function $L(x)=x^2$. (Square loss function)\n\n-   This implies the following condition:\n\n$$\nE[X_i (y_i-X_i'b)]=0 \\rightarrow \\beta = E[X_i'X_i]^{-1}E[X_i'y_i]\n$$\n\n-   This population terms must be substituted by the sample equivalent: $E(X_i) =\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i^NX_i$\n\n## Mata: OLS Estimator {.scrollable}\n\nThe estimator using Sample equivalents become:\n\n$$\n\\hat \\beta = \n\\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i X_i'X_i \\right)^{-1}\n\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i X_i'y_i=(X'X)^{-1}X'y\n$$\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.stata .cell-code}\nfrause oaxaca, clear\nkeep if lnwage !=.\nmata:\n  y = st_data(.,\"lnwage\")\n  n = rows(y)\n  x = st_data(.,\"female age educ\"),J(n,1,1)\n  exx = cross(x,x)/n\n  exy = cross(x,y)/n\n  b   = invsym(exx)*exy\n  b\nend  \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<style>div.jp-Notebook .datagrid-container {min-height: 448px; }</style>\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n(Excerpt from the Swiss Labor Market Survey 1998)\n(213 observations deleted)\n\n. mata:\n------------------------------------------------- mata (type end to exit) -----\n:   y = st_data(.,\"lnwage\")\n\n:   n = rows(y)\n\n:   x = st_data(.,\"female age educ\"),J(n,1,1)\n\n:   exx = cross(x,x)/n\n\n:   exy = cross(x,y)/n\n\n:   b = invsym(exx)*exy\n\n:   b\n                 1\n    +---------------+\n  1 |  -.145393595  |\n  2 |  .0161424301  |\n  3 |  .0719321873  |\n  4 |  1.970020725  |\n    +---------------+\n\n: end\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n. \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Inference - Distribution of $\\beta's$ {.scrollable}\n\nso: \n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny &= X\\beta + \\varepsilon \\\\\n\\sqrt N (\\hat\\beta - \\beta) &=\\frac{1}{N}\\Big[\\sum (X_iX_i')\\Big]^{-1} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt N} \\sum(X_i\\varepsilon_i)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n-   Here $\\varepsilon$ is the true population error. $\\hat\\beta$ is unbiased if the second term has an expectation of Zero. (the error is independent from $X$).\n\n-   Asymptotically, the first term is assumed fixed $E(X_i X_i')$. And, because $E(X_i\\varepsilon)=0$, and $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt N} \\sum(X_i\\varepsilon)$ is normalized, by CLT we have that:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt N (\\hat\\beta-\\beta)\\sim N(0,E(X_iX_i')^{-1} \\ E(X_iX_i'\\varepsilon ^2) \\ E(X_iX_i')^{-1})\n$$\n\n-   From here, the main question is : How do we estimate $E(X_iX'\\varepsilon_i^2)$?\n\n## Inference: Estimating SE {.scrollable}\n\n-   Lets First Rewrite the last expression:\n\n$$\nVar(\\hat\\beta)=(X'X)^{-1} X'\\Omega X (X'X)^{-1}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$\n\\Omega=\n\\left( \n\\begin{matrix}\n\\sigma_1^2 & \\sigma_{12} &  ... & \\sigma_{1N}\\\\\n\\sigma_{21} & \\sigma_{2}^2 & ... & \\sigma_{2N} \\\\\n...&...&...&...\\\\\n\\sigma_{N1} & \\sigma_{N2} & ... & \\sigma_{NN}^2 \\\\\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right)\n$$\n\nIn other words, the variance of $\\hat\\beta$ allows for arbitrary relationship among the errors, as well as heteroskedasticity. This, however is impossible to estimate!, thus we require assumptions\n\n## Homoskedasticity and independent samples {.scrollable}\n\nThe easiest route is to assume homoskedastic errors $\\sigma^2 = \\sigma_i^2 \\ \\forall i \\in 1,...,N$ . (the error is spread equally around the mean)\n\nWith independent samples $\\sigma_{ij}=0 \\ \\forall \\ i\\neq j$ .

(except for time series and serial correlation)\n\n-   For example, families may share similar unobserved factors, So would people interviewed from the same classroom, cohort, city, etc. There could be many dimensions to consider possible correlations!\n\n-   In that situation, we may be missmeasuring the magnitude of the errors (probably downward), because the $\\Omega$ is no longer diagonal: $\\sigma_{ij} \\neq 0$ for some $i\\neq j$.\n\n    -   But, estimate all parameters in an NxN matrix is unfeasible. We need assumptions!\n\n-   Say we have $G$ groups $g=(1…G)$ . We can rewrite the expression for $\\hat\\beta$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat\\beta-\\beta &= (X'X)^{-1}\\sum_{g=1}^G X'_g \\varepsilon_g \\\\\\\n&=(X'X)^{-1}\\sum_{g=1}^G s_g\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n-   We can assume that individuals are correlated within groups $E(s_g's_g) =\\Sigma_g$ , but they are uncorrelated across groups $E(s_g s_g')=0 \\ \\forall \\ g \\neq g'$ .\n-   These groups are typically known as \"**clusters**\"\n\n## Addressing Correlation {.scrollable}\n\n-   The idea of correcting for clusters is pretty simple. We just need to come up with an estimator for $\\Sigma_g$ for every cluster, so that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nVar(\\hat\\beta) &= (X'X)^{-1} \\left( \\sum_{g=1}^N \\Sigma_g \\right) (X'X)^{-1} \\\\ \n\\Sigma_g &= E( X_g' \\Omega_g X_g) \n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n-   Here $\\Omega_g$ should be an approximation of the variance covariance matrix among the errors of ALL individuals that belong to the same cluster. But how do we approximate it?\n\n-   As with the EW - HC standard errors, there are many ways to estimate Clustered Standard errors. See MacKinnon et al (2023) for reference. We will refer only to the simpler ones CV0 and CV1.\n\n> Still How?\n\n-   Recall we approximate $\\sigma^2_i$ with $\\varepsilon_i^2$. Then we can approximate $\\sigma_{ij}$ with $\\varepsilon_j \\varepsilon_i$. More specifically:\n\n$$\n\\Omega_g \\simeq \\varepsilon \\varepsilon' \\ or \\ \\Sigma_g = X'_g \\varepsilon \\varepsilon' X_g = (X'_g \\varepsilon) (\\varepsilon' X_g)\n$$\n\n-   Change $\\varepsilon$ with $\\hat\\varepsilon$, do that for every group, and done!

It is important to be aware about some unintended problems of using Correlation.\n\n1.  CV0 and CV1 work well when you have a large number of Clusters. How many? MHE(2009) says...42 (this is like having large enough samples for Asymptotic variance). If \\# clusters are small, you would do better with other approaches (including CV2 and CV3).\n\n2.  When you cluster your standard errors, you will \"most-likely\" generate larger standard errors in your model. Standard recommendation (MHE) is to cluster at the level that makes sense (based on data) and produces largest SE (to be conservative).\n\n## Role of clusters\n\n![Standard Errors](resources/clse.png)\n\n##  {.scrollable}\n\n3.  You may also consider that clustering does not work well when sample sizes within cluster are to diverse (micro vs macro clusters)\n\n4.  And there is the case where clustering is required among multiple dimensions (see `vcemway`). Where the unobserved correlation could be present in different dimensions.\n\nSo what to cluster and how?\n\n-   Mackinnon et al (2023) provides a guide on how and when to cluster your standard errors. (some are quite advanced)\n\n-   General practice, At least use Robust SE (HC2 or HC3 if sample is small), but use clustered SE for robustness.\n\n-   You may want to cluster SE based on some theoretical expectations. Choose -broader- groups for conservative analysis.\n\n-   In treatment-causal effect analysis, you may want to cluster at the \"treatment\" level.\n\n> But...Beyond hc0/1 and CV0/1 there is not much out there for correcting Standard errors in nonlinear models.\n\n# The Bootstrap\n\n## If you can't Sandwich 🥪, you can re-Sample {.scrollable}\n\n-   The discussion above refereed to the estimation of SE using $Math$. In other words, it was based on the asymptotic properties of the data. Which may not work in small samples.\n\n-   An alternative, often used by practitioners, is using re-sampling methods to obtain approximations to the coefficient distributions of interest.\n\nBut... How does it work?🤔\n\nFirst ask yourself, how does Asymptotic theory work (and econometrics)? 😱\n\n> [Note: I recommend reading the -simulation- chapter in The effect, and simulation methods chapter in CT.]{.smallcaps}\n\n## A Brief Review...again 😇 {.scrollable}\n\nIf I were to summarize most of the methodologies (ok all) we used last semester, and this one, the properties that have been derived and proofed are based on the assumption that we \"could\" always get more data (frequentist approach).\n\nThere is population (or supper population) from where we can get samples of data.\n\n1.  We get a sample ($y,X$) (of size N)\n\n2.  Estimate our model : `method`($y,X$)$\\rightarrow$ $\\beta's$\n\n3.  Repeat to infinitum\n\n4.  Collect all $\\beta's$ and summarize. (Mean and Standard deviations)\n\nDone.\n\nThe distributions you get from the above exercise should be the same as what your estimation method produces. (if not, there there is something wrong with the estimation method)\n\n## But we only get 1 Sample! {.scrollable}\n\nThe truth is we do not have access to multiple samples. Getting more data, is in fact, very expensive. So what to do ?\n\n-   Rely on Asymptotic theory\n\n-   learn Bayesian Econometrics 🥺\n\n-   or-resample? and do Bootstrap!\n\n**Basic idea of Bootstrapping**\n\n-   In the ideal scenario, you get multiple samples from your population, Estimate parameters, and done.\n\n-   If not possible you do the next best thing. You get your sample (assume is your mini-population),\n\n    -   Draw subsamples of same size (with replacement) ($y_i^s,X_i^s$)\n\n    -   estimate your model and obtain parameters $\\beta^s_i$\n\n    -   Summarize those parameters...and done, you get $Var(\\hat\\beta)$ for 🆓. (or is it?)\n\n## Bootstrapping {.scrollable}\n\n-   👢Bootstrapping is a methodology that allows you to obtain empirical estimations of standard errors making use of the data in hand, and without even knowing about Asymptotic theory (other than how to get means and variances).\n\n![Bootstrap Sample](resources/bss.png)\n\n-   And of course, it comes in different flavors.\n\n## Bootstrap Types: {.scrollable}\n\n-   **Non-parametric Bootstrap**: You draw subsamples from the main sample. Each observation has the same pr of being selected.\n\n    -   Easiest to implement ( `see bootstrap:`)\n\n    -   Works in almost all cases, but you may have situations when some covariates are rare.\n\n    -   Can be extended to allow \"clusters\" using \"block bootstrapping\". Works best if re-sampling \"follows\" the same sampling structure as your sample.\n\n-   **Parametric Bootstrap:** You estimate your model, make assumptions of your model error.\n\n    -   You need to implement it on your own. $y^s=x\\hat b+\\tilde e$ for $\\tilde e \\sim f(\\hat \\theta)$\n\n    -   It will not work well if the assumptions of the error modeling are wrong.\n\n-   **Residual bootstrap:** Estimate your model, obtain residuals. Re-sample residuals\n\n    -   Again, implement it on your own. $y^s = x\\hat b+\\tilde e$ for $\\tilde e \\sim {\\hat e_1 , ... , \\hat e_N}$\n    -   It depends even more on the assumptions of the error modeling.\n\n##  {.scrollable}\n\n-   **UWild bootstrap**: Estimate your model, obtain residuals, and re-sample residual weights.\n\n    -   Again...on your own: $y^s = x\\hat b +\\hat e * v$ , where $v \\sim ff()$ where $ff()$ is a \"good\" distribution function. $E(v)=0 \\ \\& \\ Var(v)=1$\n\n    -   Actually quite flexible, and works well under heteroskedasticity!\n\n    -   It can also allow clustered standard errors. The error $v$ no longer changes by individual, but by group. It also works well with weights.\n\n-   **UWild bootstrap-2** : Estimate your model, obtain Influence functions 😱 , and re-sample residual weights.\n\n    -   This is an extension to the previous option. But with advantages\n        -   you do not need to -reestimate- the model. Just look into how the the mean of IF's change.\n\n        -   it can be applied to linear and nonlinear model (if you know how to build the IF's)\n    -   Works well with clustered and weights.\n\n-   **CWild bootstrap:** Similar UWild Bootstrap, Obtain Influence functions under the Null (imposing restrictions), and use that to test the NULL.\n\n    -   No, you do not need to do it on your own. `see bootest` in `Stata`.\n\n    -   Works pretty well with small samples and small \\# clusters. Probably the way to go if you really care about Standard errors.\n\n## How to Bootstrap? in `Stata`\n\nI have a few notes on Bootstrapping here [Bootstrapping in Stata](https://friosavila.github.io/playingwithstata/main_bootstrap.html). But let me give you the highlights for the most general case.\n\n1.  Most (if not all commands) in `Stata` allow you to obtain bootstrap standard errors, by default. see:`help [cmd]`\n\n    they usually have the following syntax:\n\n    ```stata \n    [cmd] y x1 x2 x3, vce(bootstrap, options)\n    regress lnwage educ exper female, vce(bootstrap, reps(100))\n    ```\n\n2.  However, you can also Bootstrap that commands that do not have their own `bootstrap` option.\n\n    ```stata \n    bootstrap:[cmd] y x1 x2 x3, \n    bootstrap, reps(100):regress lnwage educ exper female\n    bootstrap, reps(100) cluster(isco):regress lnwage educ exper female\n    ```\n\n##  {.scrollable}\n\n3.  This last command may allow you to bootstrap multiple models at the same time, although it does require a bit of programming.

If the re-sampling process does not simulate the true sampling design, we may miss important information when constructing SE.\n2.  When the parameters are estimated using \"hard\" cutoffs or restricted distributions, it may not produce good approximations for SE.\n3.  You usually require MANY repetitions (standard = 50, but you probably want 999 or more). The more the better, but has some computational costs. (specially simple bs)\n4.  Some methods play better with weighted samples, clusters, and other survey designs than others. And some require more know-how than others.\n\nSo choose your 🔫weapon wisely!\n\n# Small Diversion 🦌: The Delta Method\n\n## Variance of nonlinear functions {.scrollable}\n\n::: incremental\n-   Some times (perhaps not with simple OLS) you many need to estimate Standard errors for transformations of your main coefficient of interest, or combinations of those coefficients.\n\n-   Say that you estimated $\\theta \\sim N(\\mu_\\theta, \\sigma^2_\\theta)$ but are interested in the distribution of $g(\\theta)$. How do you do this?\n\n-   Two options:\n\n    a)  you re estimate $g(\\theta$) instead, or\n    b)  you make an approximation, using the **Delta Method**\n\n-   How does it work?\\\n:::\n\n##  {.scrollable}\n\n-   The **Delta method** uses the linear approximations to approximate the distribution of otherwise not known distributions.\n\n-   Further, It relies on the fact that linear transformations a normal distribution, is on itself normal. For example:\n\n$$\ng(\\hat \\theta) \\simeq g(\\theta) + g'(\\hat\\theta) (\\hat \\theta-\\theta)\n$$\n\n-   This states that the nonlinear function $g(\\theta)$ can be \"locally\" approximated as a linear function in the neighborhood of $g(\\theta)$.\n\n-   Predictions above or below are approximated using the slope of the function. $g'(\\theta)$.\n\n-   So, if we take the variance, we get:\n\n$$\nVar(g(\\hat \\theta)) \\simeq  Var \\left(g(\\theta)+ g'(\\hat\\theta) (\\hat \\theta-\\theta)\\right) \n=g'(\\hat\\theta)^2 Var(\\theta)\n$$\n\n## Delta Method: Visualization\n\n![](resources/dm.png)\n\n## \n\nIt can go multivariate as well:\\\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ng(\\hat \\theta, \\hat \\gamma)-g(\\theta,\\gamma) &\\simeq N(0,\\nabla g ' \\Sigma \\nabla g) \\\\\n\\nabla g ' &=   [\\begin{matrix}\n    dg/d\\theta & dg/d\\gamma \n  \\end{matrix}]\n\\end{aligned}  \n$$\n\n## So why do we care: {.scrollable}\n\nTwo reasons:\n\n-   Nonlinear models need this kind of approximations to do statistical inference (probit/logit)\n\n-   Recall that when using Robust Standard errors Joint hypothesis Should be done with Care...\n\nConsider a linear set of restrictions imposed by the $H_0: R\\beta = r$.\n\n1.

In addition to letting coefficents vary \"too much\"\n\n-   An alternative is to use **Ridge** regression, which instead Minimizes the following:\n\n$$\nrSS = \\sum_i(y_i - X_i \\beta)^2+ \\lambda \\sum_{k=1}^K\\beta_k^2\n$$\n\n-   This essentially aims to find parameters that reduces SSR, but also \"controls\" for how large $\\beta's$ can be, using a shrinkage penalty that depends on $\\lambda$.\n\n\n-   If $\\lambda = 0$ you get Standard OLS, and if $\\lambda \\rightarrow \\infty$ , you get a situation where all betas (but the constant) are zero. For intermediate values, you may have better models than OLS, because you can balance Bias (when $\\beta's$ are zero) with increase variance (when all $\\beta's$ vary as they \"please\")\n\n##  {.scrollable}\n\n-   We usually start with Ridge, because is relatively Easy to implement, since it has a close form Solution:\n\n$$\n \\beta = (X'X + \\lambda I)^{-1}{X'y}\n$$\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.stata .cell-code}\nfrause oaxaca, clear\nkeep if lnwage!=.\ngen male = 1-female\nmata:\n    y = st_data(.,\"lnwage\")\n    x = st_data(.,\"educ exper female male\"),J(1434,1,1)\n    i0 = I(5);i0[5,5]=0\n    xx = (cross(x,x)) ; xy = (cross(x,y))\n    bb0 = invsym(xx)*xy \n    bb1 = invsym(xx:+i0*1)*xy \n    bb10 = invsym(xx:+i0*10)*xy \n    bb100 = invsym(xx:+i0*100)*xy \n    bb1000 = invsym(xx:+i0*1000)*xy \n    bb0,bb1,bb10,bb100,bb1000\nend \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n(Excerpt from the Swiss Labor Market Survey 1998)\n(213 observations deleted)\n\n. mata:\n------------------------------------------------- mata (type end to exit) -----\n:     y = st_data(.,\"lnwage\")\n\n:     x = st_data(.,\"educ exper female male\"),J(1434,1,1)\n\n:     i0 = I(5);i0[5,5]=0\n\n:     xx = (cross(x,x)) ; xy = (cross(x,y))\n\n:     bb0 = invsym(xx)*xy\n\n:     bb1 = invsym(xx:+i0*1)*xy\n\n:     bb10 = invsym(xx:+i0*10)*xy\n\n:     bb100 = invsym(xx:+i0*100)*xy\n\n:     bb1000 = invsym(xx:+i0*1000)*xy\n\n:     bb0,bb1,bb10,bb100,bb1000\n                  1              2              3              4\n    +-------------------------------------------------------------\n  1 |   .0858251775    .0858183338    .0857563567    .0851046501\n  2 |   .0147342796    .0147345813    .0147372042    .0147554544\n  3 |  -.0949227416    -.047396817   -.0468240416    -.041806663\n  4 |             0     .047396817    .0468240416     .041806663\n  5 |   2.218849962    2.171466638    2.172174327    2.179690914\n    +-------------------------------------------------------------\n                  5\n     ----------------+\n  1     .0778292498  |\n  2     .0146298058  |\n  3    -.0208062854  |\n  4     .0208062854  |\n  5     2.266275433  |\n     ----------------+\n\n: end\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n. \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Lasso and Elastic Net {.scrollable}\n\n-   Ridge is a relatively easy model to understand and estimate, since it has a close form solution. It has the slight disadvantage that you still estimate a coefficient for \"every\" variable (tho some are very small)\n\n-   Another approach, that overcomes this advantage is known as Lasso.\n\n$$\nLSS = \\sum_i(y_i - X_i \\beta)^2+ \\lambda \\sum_{k=1}^K |\\beta_k|\n$$\n\n-   and the one known as Elastic net\n\n$$\neSS = \\sum_i(y_i - X_i \\beta)^2+ \\lambda_L \\sum_{k=1}^K |\\beta_k| + \n\\lambda_r \\sum_{k=1}^K \\beta_k^2\n$$\n\n-   Lasso has the advantage of forcing some coefficients exactly to zero, when $\\lambda$ is sufficiently large.\n\n-   Elastic net tries to use the benefits from both approaches.\n\n## Lasso vs Ridge\n\n![](resources/image-394882719.png)\n\n## Considerations:\n\nAs with many methodologies, the benefits from this approaches is not free.\n\n1.  You need to choose tuning parameters \"wisely\" using approaches such as AIC, BIC, or cross validation.\n2.  The model you get may improve prediction, but inference is not as straight forward.\n3.  It also requires working with Standardized coefficients. (so the same penalty can be used for all variables in the model.\n\nNevertheless, they can be used as starting point for model selection.\n\nif interested, look into `Stata` introduction to `Lasso` regression. `help Lasso intro`\n\n## Brief Example:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.stata .cell-code}\nfrause oaxaca, clear\nkeep if lnwage!=.\nqui:reg lnwage i.age\npredict p_ols\nqui:elasticnet linear lnwage i.age, selection(cv, alllambdas)  alpha(0)\npredict p_ridge\nqui:lasso linear lnwage i.age, selection(cv, alllambdas)  \npredict p_lasso\nqui:elasticnet linear lnwage i.age, selection(cv, alllambdas)   \npredict p_elastic\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n(Excerpt from the Swiss Labor Market Survey 1998)\n(213 observations deleted)\n(option xb assumed; fitted values)\n(options xb penalized assumed; linear prediction with penalized coefficients)\n(options xb penalized assumed; linear prediction with penalized coefficients)\n(options xb penalized assumed; linear prediction with penalized coefficients)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![](resources/image-1604739776.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Shrinking Coefficients\n\n![Lasso vs Ridge](resources/lasso_ridge.png)\n\n# Next: Non & Semi Parametric models\n\n",
