<p><strong>Source</strong>: R.C. Fair (1978), “A Theory of Extramarital Affairs,” Journal of Political Economy 86, 45-61, 1978.<br>
I collected the data from Professor Fair’s web cite at the Yale University Department of Economics. He originally obtained the data from a survey by Psychology Today. Used in Text: not used</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This is an interesting data set for problem sets starting in Chapter 7. Even though naffairs (number of extramarital affairs a woman reports) is a count variable, a linear model can be used to model its conditional mean as an approximation. Or, you could ask the students to estimate a linear probability model for the binary indicator affair, equal to one of the woman reports having any extramarital affairs. One possibility is to test whether putting the single marriage rating variable, ratemarr, is enough, against the alternative that a full set of dummy variables is needed; see pages 239-240 for a similar example. This is also a good data set to illustrate Poisson regression (using naffairs) in Section 17.3 or probit and logit (using affair) in Section 17.1.</p>

Blend and van Ravensway kindly provided the data, which were obtained from a telephone survey conducted by the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at MSU. Used in Text: pages 195, 217, 259-260, 598</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This data set is close to a true experimental data set because the price pairs facing a family were randomly determined. In other words, the family head was presented with prices for the eco-labeled and regular apples, and then asked how much of each kind of apple the family would buy at the given prices. As predicted by basic economics, the own price effect is negative (and strong) and the cross price effect is positive (and strong). While the main dependent variable, ecolbs, piles up at zero, estimating a linear model is still worthwhile. Interestingly, because the survey design induces a strong positive correlation between the prices of eco-labeled and regular apples, there is an omitted variable problem if either of the price variables is dropped from the demand equation. A good exam question is to show a simple regression of ecolbs on ecoprc and then a multiple regression on both prices, and ask students to decide whether the price variables must be positively or negatively correlated.</p>

The variables include the S&amp;P 500 index, Consumer Price Index (CPI), CPI for food, average gas price, unemployment rate, and dummy variables for events such as Hurricane Katrina, the 9/11 attacks, and the Iraq invasion. The dataset allows for the analysis of the relationship between economic conditions and public approval ratings.</p></li>
<li><p>Potential research ideas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Investigate the impact of changes in gas prices on the Gallup approval rate. This could involve analyzing the relationship between real gas prices and approval ratings, and exploring whether the effect varies depending on the magnitude or direction of gas price changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Examine the relationship between the unemployment rate and approval ratings. This could include analyzing whether changes in the unemployment rate lead to changes in approval ratings, and whether the effect is symmetric (i.e., does an increase in unemployment have the same magnitude of impact as a decrease).</p></li>
<li><p>Explore the impact of major events, such as Hurricane Katrina, the 9/11 attacks, and the Iraq invasion, on approval ratings. This could involve assessing the short-term and long-term effects of these events on public approval.</p></li>
<li><p>Investigate the relationship between inflation (as measured by the CPI and CPI for food) and approval ratings. This could include analyzing whether changes in inflation, particularly in food prices, have a significant impact on public approval.</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze the dynamic relationship between the S&amp;P 500 index and approval ratings. This could involve examining whether changes in the stock market lead to changes in approval ratings, and whether the effect is asymmetric (i.e., do positive and negative stock market movements have different impacts).</p></li>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: These data were collected by Patrick Tulloch, an MSU economics major, for a term project. The “athletic success” variables are for the year prior to the enrollment and academic data. Updating these data to get a longer stretch of years, and including appearances in the “Sweet 16” NCAA basketball tournaments, would make for a more convincing analysis. With the growing popularity of women’s sports, especially basketball, an analysis that includes success in women’s athletics would be interesting.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This is an unbalanced panel data set in the sense that as many as three years of data are available for each faculty member but where some have fewer than three years. It is not clear that something like a fixed effects or first differencing analysis makes sense: in effect, approaches that remove the heterogeneity control for too much by controlling for unobserved heterogeneity – which, in this case, includes faculty intelligence, talent, and motivation. Presumably, these factors enter into the publication index. It is hard to think we want to hold the main factors driving productivity fixed when trying to measure the effect of productivity on salary. Pooled OLS regression with “cluster robust” standard errors seems more natural. On the other hand, if we want to measure the return to having a degree from a top 20 Ph.D.&nbsp;program then we would want to control for factors that cause selection into a top 20 program. Unfortunately, this variable does not change over time, and so FD and FE are not applicable. One could include the top 20 dummy variable in a correlated random effects analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: Colleges and universities are now required to provide much better, more detailed crime data. A very rich data set can now be obtained, even a panel data set for colleges across different years. Statistics on male/female ratios, fraction of men/women in fraternities or sororities, policy variables – such as a “safe house” for women on campus, as was started at MSU in 1994 – could be added as explanatory variables. The crime rate in the host town would be a good control.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: Computer Exercise C15.3 is important for analyzing these data. There, it is shown that the instrumental variable, nearc4, is actually correlated with IQ, at least for the subset of men for which an IQ score is reported. However, the correlation between nearc4 and IQ, once the other explanatory variables are netted out, is arguably zero. (At least, it is not statistically different from zero.) In other words, nearc4 fails the exogeneity requirement in a simple linear model but it passes – at least using the crude test described above – if controls are added to the wage equation. For a more advanced course, a nice extension of Card’s analysis is to allow the return to education to differ by race. A relatively simple extension is to include blackeduc as an additional explanatory variable; its natural instrument is blacknearc4.</p>

A good term project is to have students collect a similar data set using a more recent issue of Businessweek, and to find additional variables that might explain differences in CEO compensation. My impression is that the public is still interested in CEO compensation. An interesting question is whether the list of explanatory variables included in this data set now explain less of the variation in log(salary) than they used to.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This is much bigger than the other CPS data sets even though the sample is restricted to married women. (CPS91 contains many more observations than MROZ, too.) In addition to the usual human capital variables for the women in the sample, we have information on the husband. Therefore, we can estimate a labor supply function as in Chapter 16, although the validity of potential experience as an IV for log(wage) is questionable. (MROZ contains an actual experience variable.) Perhaps more convincing is to add hours to the wage offer equation, and instrument hours with indicators for young and old children. This data set also contains a union membership indicator. The web site for the National Bureau of Economic Research makes it very easy now to download CPS data files in a variety of formats.

However, some care is required to combine Poisson regression with an endogenous explanatory variable (educ). I refer you to Chapter 19 of my book Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data. Even in the context of linear models, much can be done beyond Computer Exercise C15.2. At a minimum, the binary indicators for various religions can be added as controls.

<li><p>The dataset appears to contain information on fertility rates (births per 1000 women aged 15-44) and personal exemption values in the United States from 1913 to 1984. The data includes variables related to fertility rates (gfr, cgfr, gfr_1, gfr_2), personal exemption values (pe, cpe, cpe_1, cpe_2, cpe_3, cpe_4), and time-related variables (year, t, tsq, tcu, ww2, pill). The dataset has 72 observations.</p></li>
<li><p>Potential research ideas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Examine the relationship between personal exemption values and fertility rates: Investigate how changes in personal exemption values (pe) over time have influenced fertility rates (gfr) in the United States. This could provide insights into the economic factors that affect family planning decisions.</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze the impact of the introduction of the birth control pill: Explore how the availability of the birth control pill (pill) has affected fertility rates (gfr) in the United States. This could shed light on the societal and demographic changes associated with the widespread use of contraception.</p></li>
<li><p>Investigate the long-term trends in fertility rates: Analyze the changes in fertility rates (gfr) over the 72-year period to identify any long-term trends or patterns. This could help understand the demographic shifts and their potential implications for social and economic policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore the role of World War II on fertility rates: Examine the impact of World War II (ww2) on fertility rates (gfr) in the United States. This could provide insights into how major historical events can influence family planning and population dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p>Assess the lagged effects of personal exemption changes: Investigate the delayed effects of changes in personal exemption values (cpe_1, cpe_2, cpe_3, cpe_4) on fertility rates (gfr). This could help identify the time frame in which economic factors influence reproductive decisions.</p></li>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This is a nice example of how to go about finding exogenous variables to use as instrumental variables. Often, weather conditions can be assumed to affect supply while having a negligible effect on demand. If so, the weather variables are valid instrumental variables for price in the demand equation. It is a simple matter to test whether prices vary with weather conditions by estimating the reduced form for price.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: Currently, this data set is used in only one Computer Exercise – to illustrate the Tobit model. It can be used much earlier. First, one could just ignore the pileup at zero and use a linear model where any of the hourly benefit measures is the dependent variable. Another possibility is to use this data set for a problem set in Chapter 4, after students have read Example 4.10. That example, which uses teacher salary/benefit data at the school level, finds the expected tradeoff, although it appears to less than one-to-one. By contrast, if you do a similar analysis with FRINGE, you will not find a tradeoff. A positive coefficient on the benefit/salary ratio is not too surprising because we probably cannot control for enough factors, especially when looking across different occupations. The Michigan school-level data is more aggregated than one would like, but it does restrict attention to a more homogeneous group: high school teachers in Michigan.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: An interesting exercise is to add the percentage of the population on AFDC (afdcper) to the infant mortality equation. Pooled OLS and first differencing can give very different estimates. Adding the years 1998 and 2002 and applying fixed effects seems natural. Intervening years can be added, too, although variation in the key variables from year to year might be minimal.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This data set also can be used to illustrate the Chow test in Chapter 7. In particular, students can test whether the regression functions differ between Kentucky and Michigan. Or, allowing for different intercepts for the two states, do the slopes differ? A good lesson from this example is that a small R-squared is compatible with the ability to estimate the effects of a policy. Of course, for the Michigan data, which has a smaller sample size, the estimated effect is much less precise (but of virtually identical magnitude).</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: A nice feature of the Salomon Brothers data is that the interest rates are not averaged over a month or quarter – they are end-of-month or end-of-quarter rates. Asset pricing theories apply to such “point-sampled” data, and not to averages over a period. Most other sources report monthly or quarterly averages. This is a good data set to update and test whether current data are more or less supportive of basic asset pricing theories.</p>

For illustrating the more advanced methods in Chapter 17, a good exercise would be to have the students estimate a Tobit of re78 on train, and obtain estimates of the expected values for those with and without training.

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The response variables, earn98 and unem98, both have discreteness: the former is a corner solutions (takes on the value zero and then a range of strictly positive values) and the latter is binary. One could use these in an exercise using methods in Chapter 17. unem98 can be used in a probit or logit model, earn98 in a Tobit model, or in Poisson regression (without assuming, of course, that the Poisson distribution is correct).</p>

Students are asked to think about such issues in Computer Exercise C13 in Chapter 15. A more egregious version of this mistake would be to treat a variable such as age as a suitable instrument because it is beyond our control: clearly age has a direct effect on many economic outcomes that would play the role of the dependent variable.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This data set can be used very much like INFMRT. It contains two years of state-level panel data. In fact, it is a superset of INFMRT. The key is that it contains information on low birth weights, as well as infant mortality. It also contains state identifies, so that several years of more recent data could be added for a term project. Putting in the variable afcdprc and its square leads to some interesting findings for pooled OLS and fixed effects (first differencing). After differencing, you can even try using the change in the AFDC payments variable as an instrumental variable for the change in afdcprc.</p>

He used various sources, including www.espn.com and www.teamrankings.com/ncaa-basketball/rpi-ranking/rpi-rating-by-team. Used in Text: not used</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This is a nice example of how multiple regression analysis can be used to determine whether rankings compiled by experts – the so-called pre-season RPI in this case – provide additional information beyond what we can obtain from widely available data bases. A simple and interesting question is whether, once the previous year’s post-season RPI is controlled for, does the pre-season RPI – which is supposed to add information on recruiting and player development – help to predict performance (such as win percentage or making it to the NCAA men’s basketball tournament). For the binary outcome that indicates making it to the NCAA tournament, a probit or logit model can be used for courses that introduce more advanced methods. There are some other interesting variables, such as coaching experience, that can be included, too.</p>

<li><p>The provided dataset contains information on the civilian unemployment rate (unem), the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (inf), and the lagged values of these variables (inf_1 and unem_1) for the years 1948 through 2003. The dataset also includes two derived variables, cinf (the change in inflation) and cunem (the change in unemployment), which may be used to explore the relationship between inflation and unemployment, commonly known as the Phillips curve.</p></li>
<li><p>Potential research ideas:</p></li>
<li><p>Investigating the relationship between inflation and unemployment: Using the provided variables, researchers could explore the validity of the Phillips curve hypothesis, which suggests an inverse relationship between these two economic indicators. This analysis could involve regression models, time series analysis, or other appropriate statistical techniques.</p></li>
<li><p>Analyzing the dynamics of inflation and unemployment: The dataset allows for the examination of how changes in inflation (cinf) and unemployment (cunem) are related over time. Researchers could investigate the lead-lag relationships between these variables and explore the potential for policy implications.</p></li>
<li><p>Exploring the impact of lagged variables: The inclusion of lagged values for inflation (inf_1) and unemployment (unem_1) provides an opportunity to study the role of past economic conditions in shaping current outcomes. Researchers could investigate the predictive power of these lagged variables and their influence on the Phillips curve relationship.</p></li>
<li><p>Comparing the Phillips curve across different time periods: Given the long time span covered by the dataset (1948-2003), researchers could analyze how the relationship between inflation and unemployment has evolved over time. This could involve identifying structural breaks, regime shifts, or other changes in the underlying dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p>Extending the analysis to other economic variables: Depending on the research question, the dataset could be supplemented with additional economic indicators, such as GDP growth, interest rates, or other relevant factors.

Used in Text: pages 155, 444, 454-455, 486</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: These data can be used in a somewhat crude simultaneous equations analysis, either focusing on one year or pooling the two years. (In the latter case, in an advanced class, you might have students compute the standard errors robust to serial correlation across the two time periods.) The demand equation would have ltothsg as a function of lrent, lavginc, and lpop. The supply equation would have ltothsg as a function of lrent, pctst, and lpop. Thus, in estimating the demand function, pctstu is used as an IV for lrent. Clearly one can quibble with excluding pctstu from the demand equation, but the estimated demand function gives a negative price effect. Getting information for 2000 and 2010, and adding many more college towns, would make for a much better analysis. Information on number of spaces in on-campus dormitories would be a big improvement, too.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This is closer to the data actually used in the Papke paper as it is at the school (building) level. It is unbalanced because data on scores and some of the spending and other variables is missing for some schools. While the usual RE and FE methods can be applied directly, obtaining the correlated random effects version of the Hausman test is more advance. Computer Exercise 17 in Chapter 14 walks the reader through it.</p>

<p><strong>Source</strong>: Rouse, C.E. (1998), “Private School Vouchers and Student Achievement: An Evaluation of the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program,” Quarterly Journal of Economics 113, 553-602. Professor Rouse kindly provided the original data set from her paper. Used in Text: pages 529-530</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This is a condensed version of the data set used by Professor Rouse. The original data set had missing information on many variables, including pre-program and post-program test scores. I did not impute any missing data and have dropped observations that were unusable without filling in missing data. There are 990 students in the current data set but pre-program test scores are available for only 328 of them. This is a good example of where eligibility for a program is randomized but participation need not be. In addition, even if we look at just the effect of eligibility (captured in the variable selectyrs) on the math test score (mnce), we need to confront the fact that attrition (students leaving the district) can bias the results. Controlling for the pre-policy test score, mnce90, can help – but at the cost of losing two-thirds of the observations. A simple regression of mnce on selectyrs followed by a multiple regression that adds mnce90 as a control is informative. The selectyrs dummy variables can be used as instrumental variables for the choiceyrs variable to try to estimate the effect of actually participating in the program (rather than estimating the so-called intention-to-treat effect). Computer Exercise C15.11 steps through the details.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: Barry Murphy, of the University of Portsmouth in the UK, has pointed out that for several observations the values for exper and tenure are in logical conflict. In particular, for some workers the number of years with current employer (tenure) is greater than overall work experience (exper). At least some of these conflicts are due to the definition of exper as “potential” work experience, but probably not all. Nevertheless, I am using the data set as it was supplied to me.</p>
