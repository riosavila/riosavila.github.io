One additional possibility is to investigate whether the coefficients from the regression of prate on mrate, log(totemp) differ by whether the plan is a sole plan. The Chow test (see Section 7.4), and the less restrictive version that allows different intercepts, can be used.</p>

<p>Used in Text: not used</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This is not so much a data set as a summary of so-called “administrative per se” laws at the state level, for three different years. It could be supplemented with drunk-driving fatalities for a nice econometric analysis. In addition, the data for 2000 or later years can be added, forming the basis for a term project. Many other explanatory variables could be included. Unemployment rates, state-level tax rates on alcohol, and membership in MADD are just a few possibilities.</p>

<p><strong>Source</strong>: R.C. Fair (1978), “A Theory of Extramarital Affairs,” Journal of Political Economy 86, 45-61, 1978.</p>
<p>I collected the data from Professor Fair’s web cite at the Yale University Department of Economics. He originally obtained the data from a survey by Psychology Today.</p>
<p>Used in Text: not used</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This is an interesting data set for problem sets starting in Chapter 7. Even though naffairs (number of extramarital affairs a woman reports) is a count variable, a linear model can be used to model its conditional mean as an approximation. Or, you could ask the students to estimate a linear probability model for the binary indicator affair, equal to one of the woman reports having any extramarital affairs. One possibility is to test whether putting the single marriage rating variable, ratemarr, is enough, against the alternative that a full set of dummy variables is needed; see pages 239-240 for a similar example. This is also a good data set to illustrate Poisson regression (using naffairs) in Section 17.3 or probit and logit (using affair) in Section 17.1.</p>

Blend and van Ravensway kindly provided the data, which were obtained from a telephone survey conducted by the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at MSU.</p>
<p>Used in Text: pages 195, 217, 259-260, 598</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This data set is close to a true experimental data set because the price pairs facing a family were randomly determined. In other words, the family head was presented with prices for the eco-labeled and regular apples, and then asked how much of each kind of apple the family would buy at the given prices. As predicted by basic economics, the own price effect is negative (and strong) and the cross price effect is positive (and strong). While the main dependent variable, ecolbs, piles up at zero, estimating a linear model is still worthwhile. Interestingly, because the survey design induces a strong positive correlation between the prices of eco-labeled and regular apples, there is an omitted variable problem if either of the price variables is dropped from the demand equation. A good exam question is to show a simple regression of ecolbs on ecoprc and then a multiple regression on both prices, and ask students to decide whether the price variables must be positively or negatively correlated.</p>

The “athletic success” variables are for the year prior to the enrollment and academic data. Updating these data to get a longer stretch of years, and including appearances in the “Sweet 16” NCAA basketball tournaments, would make for a more convincing analysis. With the growing popularity of women’s sports, especially basketball, an analysis that includes success in women’s athletics would be interesting.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The attendance figures were obtained by requiring students to slide their ID cards through a magnetic card reader, under the supervision of a teaching assistant. You might have the students use final, rather than the standardized variable, so that they can see the statistical significance of each variable remains exactly the same. The standardized variable is used only so that the coefficients measure effects in terms of standard deviations from the average score.</p>

<p>Professors Baser and Pema kindly provided the data.</p>
<p>Used in Text: not used</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This is an unbalanced panel data set in the sense that as many as three years of data are available for each faculty member but where some have fewer than three years. It is not clear that something like a fixed effects or first differencing analysis makes sense: in effect, approaches that remove the heterogeneity control for too much by controlling for unobserved heterogeneity – which, in this case, includes faculty intelligence, talent, and motivation. Presumably, these factors enter into the publication index. It is hard to think we want to hold the main factors driving productivity fixed when trying to measure the effect of productivity on salary. Pooled OLS regression with “cluster robust” standard errors seems more natural.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we want to measure the return to having a degree from a top 20 Ph.D.&nbsp;program then we would want to control for factors that cause selection into a top 20 program. Unfortunately, this variable does not change over time, and so FD and FE are not applicable. One could include the top 20 dummy variable in a correlated random effects analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: There are many possibilities with this data set. In addition to number of prenatal visits, smoking and alcohol consumption (during pregnancy) are included as explanatory variables. These can be added to equations of the kind found in Exercise C6.10. In addition, the one- and five-minute APGAR scores are included. These are measures of the well being of infants just after birth. An interesting feature of the score is that it is bounded between zero and 10, making a linear model less than ideal. Still, a linear model would be informative, and you might ask students about predicted values less than zero or greater than 10.</p>

Statistics on male/female ratios, fraction of men/women in fraternities or sororities, policy variables – such as a “safe house” for women on campus, as was started at MSU in 1994 – could be added as explanatory variables.

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: Computer Exercise C15.3 is important for analyzing these data. There, it is shown that the instrumental variable, nearc4, is actually correlated with IQ, at least for the subset of men for which an IQ score is reported. However, the correlation between nearc4 and IQ, once the other explanatory variables are netted out, is arguably zero. (At least, it is not statistically different from zero.) In other words, nearc4 fails the exogeneity requirement in a simple linear model but it passes – at least using the crude test described above – if controls are added to the wage equation.</p>
<p>For a more advanced course, a nice extension of Card’s analysis is to allow the return to education to differ by race. A relatively simple extension is to include blackeduc as an additional explanatory variable; its natural instrument is blacknearc4.</p>

In addition to the usual human capital variables for the women in the sample, we have information on the husband. Therefore, we can estimate a labor supply function as in Chapter 16, although the validity of potential experience as an IV for log(wage) is questionable. (MROZ contains an actual experience variable.) Perhaps more convincing is to add hours to the wage offer equation, and instrument hours with indicators for young and old children. This data set also contains a union membership indicator.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: Currently, this data set is used in only one Computer Exercise – to illustrate the Tobit model. It can be used much earlier. First, one could just ignore the pileup at zero and use a linear model where any of the hourly benefit measures is the dependent variable. Another possibility is to use this data set for a problem set in Chapter 4, after students have read Example 4.10. That example, which uses teacher salary/benefit data at the school level, finds the expected tradeoff, although it appears to less than one-to-one. By contrast, if you do a similar analysis with FRINGE, you will not find a tradeoff. A positive coefficient on the benefit/salary ratio is not too surprising because we probably cannot control for enough factors, especially when looking across different occupations. The Michigan school-level data is more aggregated than one would like, but it does restrict attention to a more homogeneous group: high school teachers in Michigan.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This example can promote an interesting discussion of instrument validity, and in particular, how a variable that is beyond our control – for example, whether the first two children have the same gender – can, nevertheless, affect subsequent economic choices. Students are asked to think about such issues in Computer Exercise C13 in Chapter 15. A more egregious version of this mistake would be to treat a variable such as age as a suitable instrument because it is beyond our control: clearly age has a direct effect on many economic outcomes that would play the role of the dependent variable.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This data set can be used very much like INFMRT. It contains two years of state-level panel data. In fact, it is a superset of INFMRT. The key is that it contains information on low birth weights, as well as infant mortality. It also contains state identifies, so that several years of more recent data could be added for a term project. Putting in the variable afcdprc and its square leads to some interesting findings for pooled OLS and fixed effects (first differencing). After differencing, you can even try using the change in the AFDC payments variable as an instrumental variable for the change in afdcprc.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This is a nice example of how multiple regression analysis can be used to determine whether rankings compiled by experts – the so-called pre-season RPI in this case – provide additional information beyond what we can obtain from widely available data bases. A simple and interesting question is whether, once the previous year’s post-season RPI is controlled for, does the pre-season RPI – which is supposed to add information on recruiting and player development – help to predict performance (such as win percentage or making it to the NCAA men’s basketball tournament). For the binary outcome that indicates making it to the NCAA tournament, a probit or logit model can be used for courses that introduce more advanced methods. There are some other interesting variables, such as coaching experience, that can be included, too.</p>

<p>Used in Text: pages 155, 444, 454-455, 486</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: These data can be used in a somewhat crude simultaneous equations analysis, either focusing on one year or pooling the two years. (In the latter case, in an advanced class, you might have students compute the standard errors robust to serial correlation across the two time periods.) The demand equation would have ltothsg as a function of lrent, lavginc, and lpop. The supply equation would have ltothsg as a function of lrent, pctst, and lpop. Thus, in estimating the demand function, pctstu is used as an IV for lrent. Clearly one can quibble with excluding pctstu from the demand equation, but the estimated demand function gives a negative price effect.</p>

<p><strong>Source</strong>: Rouse, C.E. (1998), “Private School Vouchers and Student Achievement: An Evaluation of the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program,” Quarterly Journal of Economics 113, 553-602.</p>
<p>Professor Rouse kindly provided the original data set from her paper.</p>
<p>Used in Text: pages 529-530</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: This is a condensed version of the data set used by Professor Rouse. The original data set had missing information on many variables, including pre-program and post-program test scores. I did not impute any missing data and have dropped observations that were unusable without filling in missing data. There are 990 students in the current data set but pre-program test scores are available for only 328 of them.</p>
<p>This is a good example of where eligibility for a program is randomized but participation need not be. In addition, even if we look at just the effect of eligibility (captured in the variable selectyrs) on the math test score (mnce), we need to confront the fact that attrition (students leaving the district) can bias the results. Controlling for the pre-policy test score, mnce90, can help – but at the cost of losing two-thirds of the observations. A simple regression of mnce on selectyrs followed by a multiple regression that adds mnce90 as a control is informative.</p>
<p>The selectyrs dummy variables can be used as instrumental variables for the choiceyrs variable to try to estimate the effect of actually participating in the program (rather than estimating the so-called intention-to-treat effect). Computer Exercise C15.11 steps through the details.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wage1">WAGE1</h2>
<p><strong>Source</strong>: These are data from the 1976 Current Population Survey, collected by Henry Farber when he and I were colleagues at MIT in 1988.</p>
<p>Used in Text: pages 6, 30-31, 33, 73, 86, 123, 178, 189, 214, 222, 224, 227, 228-229, 232-233, 235, 257, 265-266, 316, 644</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: Barry Murphy, of the University of Portsmouth in the UK, has pointed out that for several observations the values for exper and tenure are in logical conflict. In particular, for some workers the number of years with current employer (tenure) is greater than overall work experience (exper). At least some of these conflicts are due to the definition of exper as “potential” work experience, but probably not all. Nevertheless, I am using the data set as it was supplied to me.</p>

<p>Professor Neumark kindly provided the data, of which I used just the data for 1980.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: As with WAGE1, there are some clear inconsistencies among the variables tenure, exper, and age. I have not been able to track down the source of the inconsistency, and so any changes would be effectively arbitrary. Instead, I am using the data as provided by the authors of the above QJE article.</p>

<p>Used in Text: not used</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong>: The dependent variables deaths, heart, and liver each can be regressed on alcohol as nice simple regression examples. The conventional wisdom is that wine is good for the heart but not for the liver, something that is apparent in the regressions. Because the number of observations is small, this can be a good data set to illustrate calculation of the OLS estimates and statistics.</p>
