        "\n",
        "-   A Survey is a source of data that aims to collect information from a population of interest, to underestand some characteristics, behaviors, or opinions of that population as a whole.\n",
        "    -   The population of interest can be individuals, households, firms, etc.\n",
        "-   They can be useful to identify and analyze policy questions.\n",
        "-   However, they are secondary data, and thus have limitations in terms of the questions that can be answered with them.\n",
        "    -   You cannot answer questions that require data that was not collected.\n",
        "    -   They can also be limited to Interviewee recall, or willingness to answer.\n",
        "    -   Or how accessible the population of interest is.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example of Surveys\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Current Population Survey (CPS)\n",
        "    -   Monthly survey of 60,000 households in the US.\n",

        "\n",
        "## What makes a good survey?\n",
        "\n",
        "-   A Good survey is one that allows you to obtain estimates of statistics of interest for the population with \"Tolerable\" levels of Accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   To do this, you need to have a good sampling design (representation and \"independence of the population\") and a good questionnaire design (questions that are clear and easy to answer).\n",
        "\n",
        "-   A good survey needs to be representative of the population of interest. To do this appropriately, data will be collected based on a **frame** that will be used to select the sample.\n",

        "## Simple\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Each observation in the \"frame\" has the same probability of being selected in the sample.\n",

        "-   It may be difficult to implement in practice, because of cost and logistics. (distance)\n",
        "\n",
        "-   It could also have problems of representativeness for small groups. (rare events)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Clustered\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Using some criteria, location for example, the population is divided into clusters.\n",
        "-   For the sample selection, certain clusters are selected at random, and \"some\" observations within each selected.\n",
        "-   This is more feasible in practice, because takes advantage of the \"clustering\" of the population.\n",
        "-   However, one may need to account for possible \"common shocks\" that people within the same cluster may have.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Stratified\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Some times, statistics are required to accurately represent certain groups of the population. (by region, race, income level, etc)\n",
        "-   In such cases, data can be collected in a way that ensures that the sample has enough observations for each group of interest.\n",
        "    -   It would be as collecting multiple samples, one for each group of interest.\n",

        "    -   Rarely one assumes equal probability of selection. (Different sampling weights)\n",
        "    -   Use of Stratatification and Clustering may require special treatment.\n",
        "-   Something else: Panel data\n",
        "    -   Because of attrition, it can be difficult to analyze if representativeity is required.\n",
        "    -   However, it can be useful to analyze dynamics.\n",

        "-   **Superpopulation Approach**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   Associated with data modeling.\n",

        "\n",
        "    -   With large enough samples, he \"finite sample correction\" is negligible.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Basic Summary Statistics:\n",

        "\n",
        "-   Simply said, a weight $w_i=\\frac{1}{n*\\pi_i}$ is a measure of how many observations in the population are represented by observation $i$ in the sample.\n",
