## Why are we here?

- If you are reading this, you are probably interested in the Microeconometrics path of Research methods II.

- This course assumes you are familiar with the basics of econometrics and statistics. 
  - We will not cover questions from Research methods I. You probably know the answers to those questions already!

- This course will focus on tools that are commonly used in empirical research in economics:

  - We will emphasize the use of Household Surveys (with the issues it entails) 

  - And focus on applied econometrics using cross-sectional data, for distributional analysis and policy simulation.

- Thus, we will do much more use of empirical tools and software than we did in Research methods I.

-  We will have 7 Sessions, 2 homeworks, and 1 exam.
