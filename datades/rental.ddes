1. Dataset information:
   - Datafile name: RENTAL.DES
   - Dataset title (if known): Not provided
   - Suggested title: City-Level Rental and Demographic Data

2. The dataset contains information on various characteristics of cities, including population, college student enrollment, average rent, housing units, and per capita income. The data spans two time periods, 1980 and 1990, and includes both the original values and the changes in these variables over the 10-year period. The dataset appears to be focused on understanding the rental housing market and its relationship with demographic and economic factors in different cities.

3. Potential research ideas:

   1. Examining the relationship between college student enrollment and rental housing market characteristics: This could involve analyzing how changes in student enrollment over time are associated with changes in average rent, renter-occupied units, and other housing market indicators.

   2. Investigating the impact of population growth on rental housing affordability: Researchers could explore how changes in city population are related to changes in average rent and the availability of affordable rental housing.

   3. Analyzing the role of per capita income in shaping rental housing demand and supply: This could involve studying how changes in per capita income are associated with changes in rental prices, the number of renter-occupied units, and the overall housing market.

   4. Exploring the spatial distribution of rental housing and its relationship with demographic and economic factors: Researchers could investigate how the characteristics of rental housing vary across different cities and how these variations are linked to factors such as population, student enrollment, and income.

   5. Assessing the impact of economic and demographic changes on the rental housing market: Researchers could use the data to develop models that predict how changes in factors like population, income, and student enrollment might affect the rental housing market in the future.
