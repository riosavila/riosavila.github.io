1. Dataset information:
   - Datafile name: voucher.des
   - Dataset title (if known): Not provided
   - Suggested title: Student Voucher Program Data

2. The dataset appears to contain information about a student voucher program. It includes variables related to student demographics (race, gender), application and selection for the voucher program, and academic performance as measured by math test scores. The data covers the years 1990 to 1994 and includes information on whether students were selected for the program, the number of years they attended the choice school, and their math test scores.

3. Potential research ideas:

1. Examine the relationship between student demographics (race, gender) and selection for the voucher program. Investigate whether there are any disparities in the selection process and explore potential factors contributing to these differences.

2. Analyze the impact of the voucher program on student academic performance, as measured by math test scores. Investigate whether attending the choice school for different durations (1-4 years) has a significant effect on student outcomes.

3. Explore the factors that influence a student's decision to attend the choice school, such as the number of years they were selected for the program. Identify any patterns or trends in the choice of attending the voucher school.

4. Investigate the long-term effects of the voucher program on student outcomes, such as high school graduation rates, college enrollment, or future earnings. This could involve linking the current dataset to additional data sources.

5. Conduct a comparative analysis between students who were selected for the voucher program and those who were not. Examine differences in academic performance, educational attainment, or other relevant outcomes to assess the overall effectiveness of the voucher program.
