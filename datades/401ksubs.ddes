3. Potential research ideas:

   - Examining the relationship between household income and 401(k) plan participation: This study could investigate how income levels and the squared term of income (incsq) influence the likelihood of 401(k) plan participation, providing insights into the role of financial resources in retirement savings decisions.

   - Analyzing the impact of marital status and gender on 401(k) plan eligibility and participation: This research could explore how marital status (marr) and gender (male) affect an individual's access to and engagement with 401(k) plans, potentially identifying any disparities in retirement savings opportunities.

   - Investigating the influence of age and family size on 401(k) plan participation: This study could examine how age, the squared term of age (agesq), and family size (fsize) are associated with 401(k) plan participation, shedding light on the life-cycle factors that shape retirement savings behavior.

   - Exploring the relationship between net total financial assets (nettfa) and 401(k) plan participation: This research could analyze how an individual's overall financial resources, as measured by net total financial assets, are linked to their decision to participate in a 401(k) plan, providing insights into the role of wealth in retirement savings.

   - Comparing 401(k) plan participation and individual retirement account (IRA) ownership: This study could investigate the interplay between 401(k) plan participation (p401k) and IRA ownership (pira), examining how these two retirement savings vehicles are utilized by individuals with different demographic and financial characteristics.
