1. Dataset information:
   - Datafile name: GPA1.DES
   - Dataset title (if known): Not provided
   - Suggested title: Student Characteristics and Academic Performance

2. The dataset contains information on 141 college students, including their demographic characteristics, academic background, campus involvement, and work and lifestyle habits. The variables cover a range of topics, such as age, class standing, gender, major, grade point averages, standardized test scores, employment status, transportation methods, extracurricular activities, and parental education levels.

3. Potential research ideas:

   a. Examine the relationship between student characteristics (e.g., gender, major, campus involvement) and academic performance (e.g., GPA, ACT scores). This could provide insights into factors that contribute to student success.

   b. Investigate the impact of work and lifestyle habits (e.g., hours worked, transportation method, alcohol consumption) on academic outcomes. This could help identify potential areas for intervention or support to improve student well-being and academic achievement.

   c. Analyze the differences in academic and extracurricular engagement between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds, as indicated by parental education levels. This could shed light on issues of educational equity and access.

   d. Explore the role of campus resources and involvement (e.g., living on campus, using a personal computer, participating in clubs) in shaping student experiences and outcomes. This could inform the development of targeted support programs.

   e. Investigate the factors that contribute to students' decisions to continue their studies beyond the traditional four-year timeline (i.e., fifth-year seniors). This could provide valuable insights into the challenges and motivations of non-traditional students.
