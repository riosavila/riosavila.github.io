1. Dataset information:
   - Datafile name: TRAFFIC1.DES
   - Dataset title (if known): Not provided
   - Suggested title: State-Level Traffic Safety Data

2. The dataset contains information on various traffic safety measures for 51 states in the United States. The variables include state postal codes, indicators for administrative revocation laws and open container laws in 1990 and 1985, death rates per 100 million miles in 1990 and 1985, speed limit information for 1990 and 1985, and calculated changes in these measures between the two years.

3. Potential research ideas:

   a. Examine the relationship between administrative revocation laws and traffic fatality rates. Investigate whether the presence of these laws in 1990 and 1985 had a significant impact on reducing deaths per 100 million miles.

   b. Analyze the effect of open container laws on traffic safety. Explore whether states with open container laws in 1990 and 1985 experienced lower death rates compared to states without such laws.

   c. Investigate the impact of changes in speed limits on traffic safety. Assess whether the transition from a 65 mph speed limit in 1985 to a 65 mph speed limit in 1990 had a measurable effect on death rates.

   d. Explore the relationship between changes in administrative revocation laws, open container laws, and speed limits, and the corresponding changes in traffic fatality rates. Determine if these policy changes had a cumulative effect on improving traffic safety.

   e. Conduct a comparative analysis of traffic safety trends between 1985 and 1990. Identify the states that experienced the most significant improvements or declines in death rates and investigate the potential factors contributing to these changes.
