   c. Analyze the differences in campaign expenditures between Democratic and Republican candidates and how these differences may affect the electoral outcomes. This could contribute to the ongoing debate about the role of money in politics.

   d. Explore the relationship between the presidential vote share and the congressional candidate's vote share within the same district. This could help understand the extent to which national political trends influence local elections.

   e. Investigate the factors that contribute to the variation in the share of the vote received by the congressional candidates. This could include examining the influence of demographic, economic, or political factors on electoral outcomes.
