1. Dataset information:
   - Datafile name: LAWSCH85.DES
   - Dataset title (if known): Not provided
   - Suggested title: Law School Characteristics and Outcomes

2. The dataset contains information on 156 law schools in the United States. The variables include the law school's ranking, median starting salary of graduates, cost of attendance, median LSAT score and college GPA of students, library volume count, number of faculty, age of the law school, size of the entering class, and geographic location (north, south, east, or west). Additionally, there are derived variables such as the logarithm of salary and cost, student-faculty ratio, and indicators for top 10, 11-25, 26-40, and 41-60 ranked schools.

3. Potential research ideas:

1. Examine the relationship between law school characteristics (e.g., ranking, LSAT, GPA, library size, faculty size) and the median starting salary of graduates. This could provide insights into the factors that contribute to higher-paying job opportunities for law school graduates.

2. Investigate the differences in law school characteristics and outcomes between schools in different geographic regions (north, south, east, west). This analysis could reveal regional variations in the legal education landscape and identify potential factors driving these differences.

3. Analyze the impact of law school ranking on various outcomes, such as starting salary, student-faculty ratio, and library resources. This could help prospective law students understand the potential benefits and trade-offs of attending higher-ranked institutions.

4. Explore the relationship between law school cost and other variables, such as ranking, LSAT, GPA, and starting salary. This could provide insights into the value proposition of legal education and the factors that influence the cost of attendance.

5. Investigate the factors that predict a law school's ranking, such as LSAT, GPA, faculty size, library resources, and geographic location. This analysis could help identify the key drivers of law school prestige and inform strategic decision-making for law school administrators.
