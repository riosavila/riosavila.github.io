The dataset also includes information on household expenditure and the commune (administrative unit) where the individual resides.

3. Potential research ideas:

   a. Examining the relationship between socioeconomic factors (e.g., age, sex, marital status, household expenditure) and health outcomes (e.g., illness, number of illness days, pharmacy visits) to identify potential disparities and inform public health interventions.

   b. Investigating the role of health insurance coverage in influencing healthcare utilization and health outcomes among the Vietnamese population, which could provide insights for policymakers.

   c. Analyzing the spatial distribution of health-related variables across different communes and exploring the potential influence of community-level factors on individual health outcomes.

   d. Studying the impact of illness and injury on individuals' ability to engage in daily activities, and the implications for their overall well-being and economic productivity.

   e. Exploring the factors associated with the use of pharmacy services, such as the prevalence of self-medication or access to primary healthcare, and the potential implications for the healthcare system.
