## Project Overview

### Objective
This project aims to analyze basketball team and player performance using a comprehensive synthetic dataset. You will apply advanced statistical modeling techniques to understand the factors influencing team success, player performance, and championship potential.

### Dataset
A comprehensive synthetic dataset (`basketball_performance_dataset.csv`) is provided, capturing multidimensional aspects of basketball performance across teams, players, and seasons.

## Data Dictionary

### Basketball Performance Dataset (`basketball_performance_dataset.csv`)

**Team and Organizational Variables**:

- `season`: Year of the basketball season
- `team_id`: Unique identifier for each team
- `team_name`: Name of the basketball team
- `team_budget`: Annual team budget (USD)
- `market_size`: Team's market size (Small/Medium/Large)
- `conference`: League conference (Eastern/Western)
- `total_team_wins`: Number of wins in the season
- `playoff_appearance`: Binary indicator of playoff qualification

**Player Demographic Variables**:

- `player_id`: Unique identifier for each player
- `player_age`: Player's age
- `position`: Player's primary position (Guard/Forward/Center)
- `height_cm`: Player's height in centimeters
- `years_in_league`: Number of years playing professionally

**Performance Metrics**:

- `games_played`: Number of games played in the season
- `points_per_game`: Average points scored per game
- `assists_per_game`: Average assists per game
- `rebounds_per_game`: Average rebounds per game
- `performance_score`: Composite performance metric
- `player_salary`: Annual player salary (USD)

**Career and Resilience Indicators**:

- `career_trajectory`: Player's career progression (-1: declining, 0: stable, 1: emerging)
- `injury_count`: Number of injuries in the season
- `injury_impact`: Estimated impact of injuries on performance

**Qualitative Data**:

- `performance_narrative`: Descriptive text about player's performance characteristics

**Prediction Target**:

- `championship_potential`: Binary indicator of potential championship success

## Analysis Tasks

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (20%)

1. Comprehensive exploratory analysis
   - Descriptive statistics for performance metrics
   - Distribution analysis of team and player variables
   - Correlation matrix between performance indicators

2. Visualization Requirements:
   - Performance variations across positions
   - Salary and performance relationships
   - Team performance by conference and market size

### Task 2: Regression Modeling (40%)

**Objective**: Develop regression models to predict player and team performance

1. Linear Regression: Predicting Performance Score
   - Dependent Variable: `performance_score`
   - Independent Variables:
     * `player_age`
     * `years_in_league`
     * `height_cm`
     * Performance metrics (points, assists, rebounds)
     * Team-level features

   Requirements:
   - Implement multiple linear regression
   - Check and address multicollinearity
   - Validate model assumptions
   - Interpret coefficients and statistical significance

2. Regularized Regression
   - Apply Ridge/Lasso regression
   - Compare model performance metrics
   - Discuss feature importance

### Task 3: Binary Outcome Prediction (40%)

**Objective**: Predict championship potential

- Dependent Variable: `championship_potential`
- Independent Variables:
  * Individual player performance metrics
  * Team-level characteristics
  * Career trajectory
  * Injury-related features

Requirements:

- Implement both Logit and Probit models
- Compare model performance using:
  * Accuracy
  * AUC-ROC
  * Confusion matrix
  
- Interpret marginal effects
- Discuss model selection criteria

## Submission Requirements
